I need to revise the following text and make it more concise and clear.

Do the work of an expert copy editor. 
Understand the context of the text, build an outline, and then revise the text according to my instructions.

If you have questions about the revisions, ask me before you start.

The returned text should maintain the same ideas and original meaning, but improve clarity and conciseness.

You should return: The revised text and only the revised text in a code block.
