and we can pick up our phone and we can tap the icon and we will get the random Cat generator installed on our iPhone as an application this is amazing you can click show me another cat it works it's a real app this does everything that the version on the web would do as M with Reit we're back for part two of our series on building mobile apps using repet and Expo in this video I'm going to show you how to take the app we built yesterday and install it on your iPhone very straightforward um now there are a lot more steps in this video it might be a bit longer uh but I've documented everything in the readme um I've uh actually walked through this entire process myself I created an App Store developer account specifically for this video um so uh we will be doing exactly the same thing this video is specific to iOS apps so if you want to build an Android app actually all of the steps on the repet and Expo side are the same you'll just have to insert basically Google Play Store steps where we do Apple stuff um maybe coming in the future uh prerequisites for this video first you have to have completed the steps in the first video there's a link down uh wherever you see this video to do that very quick very straightforward um second you'll need an apple developer account this is kind of a bummer look I don't like to tell people bad news uh but this is a little hard to do first you have to go to Apple's developer portal which you can find at developer.apple.com account um from there you'll need to pay Apple more money Tim Cook and shareholders Rejoice right apple apple gets richer so you'll need to give Apple about 99 bucks a year in order to publish apps yes even apps that just go on your phone um once that's done you have to wait about 16 to 24 hours so um just want to get that out of the way up front uh in my case it took 16 hours for this to come in apple says it could take up to 48 hours for them to approve your profile once that's done you'll have access on the iCloud side you'll be able to publish apps the good news is you only have to do this once for your account and then you'll be able to just like build uh cool stuff um so the process we're going to go through today um is basically taking the app we built uh building it on the Expo side and then pushing a preview to our device so there's some setup that has to happen um on the Apple side on the iCloud side there's some setup that has to happen on our iPhone um but once that's done we're going to have a build of this app that we can use uh we're not going to walk through the process of actually publishing this to the App Store but we're going to do everything that you need to do um in order to get that done and then you can publish your app if you choose the cool thing is that what we're going to do enables you to build basically any tool that you want to have as a native IOS app so if you want to build an automation if you want to build a prototype this is an amazing start this is going to get you all the way there and we're going to get it done um as quick as possible as simply as possible I have all these instructions also outlined in the readme the first thing I want to call out and then we're going to jump into building stuff I promise if you remixed the Expo template that we have um like right when it came out we've made some updates so the readme is updated and then the other thing that's updated is this uh config file down here rep so if you don't see that you might have to um click the three dots and click show hidden files um and if you You Know Remix this and um this config file is out of date what you can just literally do is copy that go to your Expo app that you made and paste it in if you remix this like right when you're watching this video if you just completed the first version don't worry about it this is all up to date um this just makes sure that uh we have the Expo workflows that are just going to simplify some commands um so let's get into it we have our app running here we have a very cute picture of a cat I actually don't even want to click show me another cat because of how cute this is um and what we're going to do is we're going to initialize EAS which is like the explo application service it's going to like act as the interface between um our build and Expo as well as like the uh the Apple App Store so I'm actually going to stop this app from running that's going to like make this a little easier for me to see what's going on and then we're going to run our first EAS command now in that workflow file that we just copied out you can see uh the workflow is defined these um commands are just EAS commands and so in the read me which has also been updated um if you really want to see exactly what's going on you can look and say oh like well we can select EAS and it right or we can just run this command this is a bit more of a technical tutorial you don't actually have to run these commands but I think it's worth putting in there if you want to learn more about um Expo and how that works so I'm going to click es in it we're going to run that and now I'm going to get a prompt to log in so I'm going to log into my uh Expo personal account you're going to need a username and password this is the official Expo CLI and these are all stored securely so don't worry about that um once we log in uh we're going to create a project right I don't have a project that exists maybe you do maybe you created that in an earlier step this is actually defined in the app. Json so if you want to change the name or the slug that's where we're defining these projects um that's how you can change those things I'm going to say yes so EAS is going to create my project um we're going to get an ID you can actually see this file being updated in real time with some of these project characteristics and this is going to authenticate um this application with my Expo account so we're all squared away there um if you did this in the first step you might like you run this command it says you're logged in Good To Go amazing uh this is completed running when the Run button comes back up by the way now we're going to run EAS update again this is an initialization step um this helps like configure our project and Link all that Apple goodness all the apple apple developer stuff um to our project so you might see uh some install commands some other stuff going on uh a lot of configuration is happening here again we we try to make this as simple as possible with the drop- down menu and the simple click of a button um you'll know this is successful if you see um this uh Metro bundler start and um there's an exporting step that's going to pop up this might take one or two minutes uh but once that's done um we'll have like that update step configured and again this is really just initialization stuff um so yeah in the meantime it's worth mentioning if you haven't seen the first video uh the amazing thing is you can actually do all of this from your phone so if I open up my first Expo app on my iOS device um if I really want to I can see the uh if I go to like uh the console you can actually see all of the exact same output which is pretty amazing and you could literally tap through and run these same commands in real time uh so you can see there we're exporting bundles we uploaded two app bundles I don't really even know what a bundle is um but we're we're getting it done for uh for our app here um so now we can see that we have a branch um some other details uh it's actually storing our G commits from our repet project and that includes our um our last assistant prompt uh so this step is complete we have that all good to go and what we're going to do then is we're going to click EAS publish preview iOS so again this is executing the command npx build platform iOS profile preview if you want to do this for Android you probably click the publish preview Android um so we're going to get uh some output here iOS bundle identifier um if you've ever seen applications on the App Store they all have an identifier usually it's like uh the website and then the name of the app so I'll do like G.P Palmer yes I own palmer. uh do um my first Expo app and really this can be whatever you want it to it's just kind of a formal formality um iOS only uses standard exemp encryption I don't know what that means I could probably click that link and learn more if I wanted to but I'm just going to hit yes uh as we're doing this stuff pay attention to security you should research if you're putting any sensitive information in your application that's my disclaimer do you want to log into your Apple Apple account yes we do what's your Apple ID um that's my Apple ID boom uh now we need to do a password again Expo is pretty secure with this stuff Apple has pretty strict two- Factor authentication uh you can be confident that um you're not going to do anything too bad you'll get an Apple popup if you're on iOS um and we're going to validate our account hit enter we're logged in and verified you can see there I have two teams I'm going use my individual uh Team because I want this to be as close to uh to possible as to what you're doing so we'll go with my individual account you should see again your Apple developer account that you created following the steps outlined um in the documentation again I'm going to select my individual bundle um identifier and you can kind of see if if we're thinking logically what's going through here uh we're generating some device distribution certificates I'm going to hit yes I don't have any registered devices would you like to register them I also noticed this pop up still up we'll close that out yes um how would you like to register your device we're going to say website amazing so now we get this QR code and this is where we start doing stuff on our phone um what we're going to have to do here is install what's called a development profile now a development profile uh kind of allows us to install these preview apps um and it grants some specific permissions on our phone so we kind of have to be aware of what we're doing we don't just want to install things like willy-nilly right um but if you want to read more about this there's a ton of documentation on Expo right like I can learn about this um I can read exactly what's going on and they actually give us instructions so what we're going to do here is download the profile go to settings um it's going to pop up right in our settings kind of like right in our face it's hard to miss it um and click install so I'm going to click download profile continue allow profile downloaded close and then we're going to go to our settings I'm in display and brightness but right at the top of settings profile downloaded I'm going to tap that register for development install we're going to enter a passcode I'm not going to show you what my iPhone password is and then we're going to install that it's all kinds of like passwords and credentials popping up all over the place I'm going to get totally get hacked one day like it's going to happen but now we have the device profile installed that's great uh as you can see in repet press any key if you finished device registration I will press any key um and now we have a device so I'll hit uh space to select return to submit um and we're creating stuff so you can see there's like a profile being created the project is being compressed and uploaded to EAS um there's a project fingerprinting step as well and now the project is building so we're getting there folks uh we are getting there the build has been queued so you can actually go into your Expo dashboard and you should be able to see if you go to projects the project we just created so when I click into this um you'll see a build uh and you can also go into the builds tab um to see what's going on uh what is happening here basically Expo is like spinning up a machine in the background that's going to take all of the uh all of the files that we edited everything we did in our app um and turn them into something that can go on our phone this takes between 10 and 15 minutes depending on the complexity of your application if you build something really crazy I have no idea how long this could take so now we're creating a build um rather than sit here in awkward silence or for me to like try to explain stuff for 10 minutes I'm just going to cut out and cut back in when this build is done and we'll pick it up from there okay we're back and you can see here our build is complete so took about a minute and a half for it to start we were in the queue took about 8 and 1 half minutes for it to complete about 10 minutes all wrapped up all said and done um and you'll notice in your Expo app what you should see is another QR code right first we had build cued and we're building some stuff now we have this QR code uh to install our app on our device um so what we did before right we installed that profile we configured it on that end now what we're going to do is we're going to scan this QR code and this is going to actually install our app I'm going to hit install and what you'll see in your like recent app section is that there's an app installing which is exciting um Now Matt you're probably saying you're probably saying I'm really excited I want to click this button and you're going to click the button and you're going to think your app's open but it's not uh is it now what you're probably going to do is say oh Matt I'm really excited I want to click this button there's my app is on my phone all I need to do now is open it and you're going to click the button and you're going to be disappointed because there's one final step that we have to do so exhale a sigh of relief this is the last thing we need to do before you can open your app on your phone we need to enable developer mode uh and the way to enable developer mode is to press okay on that dialogue first go into settings we're going to scroll down to the bottom we're going to go to privacy and security we're going to go all the way down to the bottom of privacy security you're going to see developer mode and you're going to toggle it on now when you turn developer mode on you're going to have to restart your device so this is the point where uh I leave you and join you once my device is restarted um you might see a few more warnings a few more security precautions these are all good things to read and understand um but what we're doing does not compromise the security of your device in any way Apple's just warning you because you're basically allowing yourself to install software on your phone so if you're going to install stuff on your phone should probably be confident that you know what it's doing um that's my disclaimer here uh I'm going to hit restart and I'm going to join you after that process is complete we are back we have enabled developer mode we have restarted our device um we have the application installed for dramatic effect I've moved the application to my home screen and I have opened the random Cat generator on repet and to show you that this is independent from what we're doing on repet I'm going to hit stop so nothing is is going on now basically what we've done is repet is a completely separate entity from our phone there's nothing running on repet that would be backing anything on our phone we have a build on Expo that we've we've then taken and pushed onto our device using that QR code using the profile that we installed earlier and now you know from the grand finale we have enabled developer mode and we can pick up our phone and we can tap the icon and we will get the random Cat generator installed on our iPhone as an application this is amazing you can click show me another cat it works it's a real app this does everything that the version on the web would do we just went through the process of taking a development version building that pushing it to our iPhone and installing it on our iPhone so now what we have is a preview of the application that is only usable by you um but it works so this video even though it's a little bit longer um even though it took a little bit of configuration even though we had to pay Apple and do all the things um we went from zero to IOS app and hopefully you're able to do this after a couple short videos and the point I want to illustrate this used to take days it used to take weeks for even for people who knew what they're doing so now the process I'm showing you ideally maybe takes an hour maybe takes a morning right like this isn't easy the some of the stuff we're doing is complicated I get it I spent a lot of time trying to figure this out before we got it to work but we have done it this is outstanding all you need is a repet account all you need is an expo and account and an iPhone and you can go from an idea that's in your head to an app that lives on your phone and then with just a few more steps and Apple's approval of course you can go to an application that lives on the App Store that you can distribute to other people that you can share with your friends with your family um so I think you know the Golden Age of app democratization is upon us we are uh entering into an era where anyone can create personal software anyone can create personal applications that live on their iPhone if you don't want to put an app on your iPhone it's actually a whole lot simpler to create something that lives on a website and then to install that on the homepage of your phone we'll have another video on how to do that soon but again I'm Matt with repet this is been part two of our Expo series is how you can take an expo app and install it through the Apple App Store through a development preview through Expo to an application on your iPhone but until next time peace
