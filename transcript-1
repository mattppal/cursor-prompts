okay and so you can see in real time that chat is appearing not only on my phone but also in the browser now we have our random Cat generator with some emojis you can see there's like some nice drop shadow and there's even an animation on the application when I click show me another cat hey it's Matt with repet here super exciting video for yall today I'm going to show you how you can build a mobile app using repet natively on your iPhone or your Android device in just a couple minutes this is part one and a two-part Series in this video I'm going to show you how to get started and have something working on your phone in just a couple minutes in part two we're going to talk about taking that and Publishing it or making it available as an application um and I think this is outstanding I remember when I was a kid when I was in Middle School and High School I always thought man I really wish I could build an app for my phone I had no idea how to do it but today I'm going to show you how to do this literally without writing any code and it's only going to take like a couple minutes so if you have a few minutes stick around with me we're going to build something really cool and there are only a couple prerequisites so the first thing you have to do is install Expo go I'm going to throw a QR code with a link to this page you can download it for Android or iOS um or if you want to use it for an emulator you can you can actually go that route as well um you might need to create an account with Expo that just takes a couple minutes and the only other thing you need is a ret account so once you have Expo go installed on your mobile device you're going to head to this template I'm going to throw a QR code for that right now and you're going to click remix um now when you click remix what we do is we create create a complete copy of this template um in your rep account so my first Expo app and now I'm remixing the template we're cloning not only all the files and the configuration but all of the installation all of the package management all of the languages Etc these are just going to be available to you in repet which is browser native this runs entirely in the cloud you don't have to worry about anything in one tab in your browser um so you can see we have all these different files next I'm going to click run and when I start running this in my browser we're going to get some pretty cool stuff we're going to see in the console tab that the application is starting up and so this QR code basically links that Expo Go app it links that project to our rep project now you're also going to see um some logs down here it takes usually a few minutes to configure that's just something on the Expo side it's pretty resource int intensive so so that might take a minute or two to set up but we're just going to take our phone and we're going to scan that QR code and click open in Expo go and you should see if you're using an iOS device if you're using an Android device uh that start to pop up here um in the bottom of of our uh console um which is going to tell us sort of that this project is compiling right um and uh again once that's done um we should see in the web view first uh this page here welcome to Expo and repet um but then second on our device right the exact same thing what's going on well Expo is built on something called react native react native just means you can build like react projects that compile to iOS compil to Android and compile to the web and that means that you can build an app once and have it available on all platforms and I want to just pause and just think about how amazing this actually is right I just for something clicked run and now I have it on my phone and I have it on uh repet on my desktop um and this is something that like previously was completely out of bounds for anyone that wasn't like a professional developer and so the democratization that's happening here for mobile apps for building um is just amazing uh and more than that what I'm going to show you is that because this is built on react assistant is going to be really good at writing react so now we have something working we have an app on our phone what you can do an assistant I found this helps with developing Expo projects is you can click settings and go to assistant prompt and now you can actually create a custom prompt so I created this prompt earlier it's called Expo project you can do something similar and I just said hey this is an expo project for building react native applications please frame your responses accordingly and this just makes sure assistant is aware of that it's of of course going to know that from the context of the file tree but now when we go back to assistant we can assume that it has all of that context and uh understands what we're building so now I'm going to say something like create an app that shows me a random image of a cat every time I press a button pretty classic I use this example frequently um but it's just for fun it's just to show you that okay well we have something working it's just kind of like a starting screen can we take this from zero to MVP and this is sort of the pattern that I would use without writing code right um agent is going to our assistant rather is going to modify this app directory that only took a few seconds I'm going to click apply it's going to make a checkpoint and on repet we have this app in our web view um now one thing I've noticed is that sometimes uh this takes a second on the Expo mobile app you might actually even have to rescan the QR code to get this working um and there so amazingly in just a couple minutes we have an app that shows random cats when you press a button uh now one thing I want to call out right is that this is pretty basic so how can we iterate on this well we can keep doing exactly what we were doing or the power of repet is that because this app is running in the browser in the cloud you can continue on the repet mobile app so what I'm going to do here is I'm going to take a screenshot of this app because I kind of like the way it looks and then I'm going to swing over to the repet mobile app um and in the repet mobile app if I go home I'm going to see my first Expo app that I just created right uh we're going to load that up I have the existing chat history I'm going to attach that app and I'm going to say um could you improve the layout on mobile um what's what's something else we could do could you make the page a bit more beautiful and playful and we're going to send that okay and so you can see in real time that chat is appearing not only on my phone but also in the browser and so we have all of the same context assistant making all of the same changes because this is the same environment and we're going to be able to actually see those changes flow through into our application um so now it's uh just taking some time to update the index file which is sort of like our homepage in that Expo application but in just a few minutes we should see um something come through so I'm going to apply these and see this one FL flowed through on the first shot now we have our random Cat generator with some emojis you can see there's like some nice drop shadow and there's even an animation on the application when I click show me another cat um so just like that we went from zero to actual mobile application that we then were able to edit using natural language using the prompts in assistant now a few call outs here because this is using assistant um agent isn't available in this environment we're working on potentially an update to to enable that but you'll have to roll with assistant for now and again like I mentioned at the start of this video um this is part one in a two-part Series so this is really about getting the app running you be able to build really anything that you can build with AI and with repet obviously um the second part of the series will be how to take this and make it live how to deploy it how to put it on your phone how to put it on other people's phones so um again I'm Matt with repet this has been how you can go from zero to working mobile app and then iterate on that app from your iPhone um really truly outstanding stuff again these tools like I never would have thought they were possible even a couple years ago so how fun building with this one I really can't wait to see what yall create uh until next time peace
