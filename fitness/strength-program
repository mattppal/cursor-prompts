<program_philosophy>
This program combines powerlifting-style strength progression with bodybuilding hypertrophy principles to simultaneously develop maximal strength and muscle mass while maintaining joint health and longevity.
</program_philosophy>

<primary_goals>
- Maximize strength in the three powerlifting movements (squat, bench, deadlift)
- Build muscle mass through strategic hypertrophy work
- Maintain joint health and structural balance
</primary_goals>

## Core Program Structure

<main_lift_protocol>
1. Opening Single
   - RPE: 8
   - Function: Determines working weight for subsequent sets
   - Frequency: Every main lift session
   
2. Working Sets
   - Sets: 4-5 (varies by focus)
   - Strength Focus: 4 sets
   - Hypertrophy Focus: 5 sets
   - Final Set: AMRAP (As Many Reps As Possible)
</main_lift_protocol>

<accessory_lift_protocol>
- Sets: 4
- Rep Range: 10-15
- Final Set: To failure
- Rest Periods: Not specified
</accessory_lift_protocol>

## Progressive Overload System

<progression_rules>
Main Lifts:
```
IF RPE_single < 8:
    NEXT_WEEK_WEIGHT = CURRENT_WEIGHT + INCREMENT
IF RPE_single > 8:
    NEXT_WEEK_WEIGHT = CURRENT_WEIGHT - INCREMENT
IF working_sets_performance > expected:
    NEXT_WEEK_WEIGHT = CURRENT_WEIGHT + INCREMENT
```

Accessory Lifts:
```
IF final_set_reps > target_range_upper:
    NEXT_WEEK_WEIGHT = CURRENT_WEIGHT + INCREMENT
IF final_set_reps < target_range_lower:
    NEXT_WEEK_WEIGHT = CURRENT_WEIGHT - INCREMENT
```
</progression_rules>

<autoregulation_parameters>
1. Primary Performance Indicators:
   - RPE on opening single
   - Performance on working sets
   - Reps achieved on AMRAP sets

2. Secondary Performance Indicators:
   - Quality of movement
   - Recovery status
   - Previous week's performance
</autoregulation_parameters>

## Exercise Categories

<exercise_classification>
Primary Compounds:
- Squat
- Bench Press
- Deadlift

Accessory Work:
- Rep Range: 10-15
- Focus: Muscle hypertrophy
- Progression: Based on final set performance
</exercise_classification>

<programming_considerations>
1. Volume Management:
   ```
   - Main lift volume varies based on focus (4-5 sets)
   - Accessory work standardized at 4 sets
   - Total volume autoregulated through performance metrics
   ```

2. Intensity Control:
   ```
   - Main lifts: RPE 8 single sets intensity ceiling
   - Working sets: Derived from single performance
   - Accessories: Controlled by rep range parameters
   ```

3. Fatigue Management:
   ```
   - Auto-regulation through RPE
   - Performance-based weight adjustments
   - Built-in volume variation
   ```
</programming_considerations>

<execution_guidelines>
1. Main Lift Session Structure:
   ```
   1. Warm-up
   2. Build to RPE 8 single
   3. Calculate working weight
   4. Perform working sets
   5. AMRAP on final set
   ```

2. Accessory Work Structure:
   ```
   1. 4 sets per movement
   2. 10-15 rep target range
   3. Final set to failure
   4. Adjust next week's weight based on performance
   ```
</execution_guidelines>

<progress_tracking>
Key Metrics to Monitor:
1. Main Lift Progression:
   - Single lift RPE accuracy
   - Working weight progression
   - AMRAP set performance

2. Accessory Lift Progression:
   - Final set rep performance
   - Weight progression over time
   - Quality of execution
