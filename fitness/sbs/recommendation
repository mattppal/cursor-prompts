## Recovery Management

### Rest Periods
| Training Element    | Minimum Rest | Optimal Rest |
|---------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Primary Compounds   | 3 minutes    | 5 minutes    |
| Secondary Compounds | 2 minutes    | 3 minutes    |
| Isolation Work      | 1 minute     | 2 minutes    |

### Deload Protocol
```markdown
Frequency: Every 4-6 weeks
Volume: Reduce by 40-50%
Intensity: Maintain 80-85% of working weights
Duration: 5-7 days
```

## Program Implementation

### Session Structure
| Phase       | Duration  | Focus         | RPE |
|-------------|-----------|---------------|-----|
| Warm-up     | 10-15 min | Movement prep | 5-6 |
| Primary     | 20-30 min | Main compound | 7-9 |
| Secondary   | 20-30 min | Support work  | 7-8 |
| Accessories | 30-40 min | Volume/pump   | 7-8 |

### Progressive Overload
```markdown
Primary Lifts:
- Weekly progression
- Based on RPE and performance
- Small increments (2.5-5 lbs)

Secondary Lifts:
- Bi-weekly progression
- Volume before weight
- Technical mastery focus
```
</implementation_strategy>

<key_recommendations>
## Final Recommendations

1. **Volume Reduction**
   - Decrease weekly frequency to 4 days
   - Focus on quality over quantity
   - Maintain intensity on key lifts

2. **Exercise Selection**
   - Prioritize compound movements
   - Rotate accessories every 4-6 weeks
   - Keep prehab/stability work constant

3. **Recovery Focus**
   - Two full rest days per week
   - Strategic deloading
   - Sleep/nutrition emphasis

4. **Progress Monitoring**
   - Track primary lift progression
   - Monitor recovery markers
   - Adjust volume based on performance
</key_recommendations>

This restructured program balances:
- Optimal training volume
- Adequate recovery time
- Sustainable progression
- Long-term development

Remember to adjust based on individual response and recovery capacity.
