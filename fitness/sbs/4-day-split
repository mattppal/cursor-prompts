<progression_model>
## Progressive Overload Strategy

### Primary Movements
```markdown
Weekly Progress:
- Based on RPE and performance
- 2.5-5 lb increases when:
  * RPE is below target
  * Form is maintained
  * Recovery is adequate
```

### Secondary Movements
```markdown
Bi-Weekly Progress:
- Increase load when hitting:
  * Upper rep ranges
  * Consistent form
  * Good bar speed
```

### Accessories
```markdown
Monthly Progress:
- Focus on mind-muscle connection
- Progress through rep ranges first
- Weight increases secondary
```

## Recovery Management

### Between Sessions
```markdown
Minimum Recovery:
- 48h between similar movement patterns
- 72h between heavy sessions
- 24h between different movement patterns
```

### Deload Protocol
```markdown
