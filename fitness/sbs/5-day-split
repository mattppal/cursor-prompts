## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Exercise Selection**
   - Rotate variations every 4-6 weeks
   - Keep primary movements constant
   - Adjust accessories based on weak points

2. **Volume Adjustment**
   - Monitor recovery between sessions
   - Reduce volume if performance decreases
   - Add volume when adaptation plateaus

3. **Fatigue Management**
   - Track primary lift performance
   - Monitor sleep quality
   - Consider recovery modalities

4. **Technical Focus**
   - Film top sets for form check
   - Maintain technical proficiency
   - Prioritize quality over quantity
