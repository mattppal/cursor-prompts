Here are the different colored tabs/cells in the program builder and what they represent:

1. Light Burgundy cells - "Rep increase" progression scheme (same as used in novice hypertrophy program)

2. Gray cells - "Set increase then reps increase" progression scheme (also from novice hypertrophy program)

3. Teal cells - "Classic Overload" progression where you assign set/rep goals and increase load when completed successfully

4. Yellow cells - "Fixed number of reps" progression where you assign total reps across all sets

5. Peach cells - Set-by-set setup (reverse pyramid by default) where load can progress on a per-set basis

The colored cells are used to distinguish between different progression schemes when setting up your program. Each color represents a different way to progress on your lifts, allowing you to mix and match different progression styles for different exercises in your program.

The program builder is designed to be flexible, letting you use any of these progression schemes for any lift by filling in the corresponding colored cells for the progression type you want to use for that particular exercise.
