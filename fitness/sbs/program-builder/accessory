# Recommended Accessory Programming Strategy

## Primary Recommendation: Light Burgundy ("Rep Increase") or Gray ("Set increase then reps increase")

These progression schemes align best with current research on hypertrophy because they:

1. Allow for progressive overload through multiple variables (reps, sets, and weight)
2. Keep you in the proven hypertrophy rep ranges (6-20 reps)
3. Ensure sufficient volume accumulation
4. Provide clear progression metrics

## Implementation Strategy:

For isolation/accessory movements:
```
- Start with 3-4 sets of 8-12 reps
- Progress by first increasing reps across all sets
- When you hit upper rep target, increase weight and drop back to lower rep target
- Keep 1-3 RIR (Reps In Reserve) on most sets
- Take final set closer to failure (0-1 RIR)
```

## Why Not Other Schemes:

1. **Teal (Classic Overload)**: 
   - Better suited for main compounds
   - Too rigid for accessories where form degradation is less critical

2. **Yellow (Fixed total reps)**:
   - Can lead to inconsistent stimulus
   - Harder to track progressive overload

3. **Peach (Set-by-set)**:
   - Unnecessarily complex for accessories
   - Better suited for main lifts where per-set load management is more important

## Research-Backed Reasoning:
- Meta-analyses show similar hypertrophy results between 6-35 reps when sets are taken close to failure
- Multiple sets (3-6) per exercise produce superior results to single sets
- Progressive overload is crucial but can be achieved through various means
- Regular exposure to near-failure sets enhances muscle growth
