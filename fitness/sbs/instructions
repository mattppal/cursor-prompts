There are six programs in this folder: “SBS Strength Program,” “SBS Strength Program Last Set RIR,” and “SBS Strength Program Reps to Failure” are in the “Original Templates” sub-folder; “SBS Hypertrophy Template” is in the “Hypertrophy Template” sub-folder; and “SBS Linear Progression” and “SBS Novice Hypertrophy” are in the “Novice Programs” sub-folder. There are also spreadsheets with lower frequency versions of most of the programs (the overall programs are the same, but you train each muscle group fewer times per week) in the “Lower Frequency Templates” sub-folder. Finally, there’s a goliath spreadsheet for creating your own programs – “SBS Program Builder” – in the “Program Builder” sub-folder.

This instruction document will walk you through how to set up and use each spreadsheet. Each spreadsheet will have a separate heading in this document, so don’t look at the pagecount for this instruction document and get scared – the information for setting up and using each spreadsheet is self-contained in one smaller part of the document. The final section of the document will contain further tips and recommendations, so make sure you read the final section.

With the exception of the novice programs, all of the SBS programs are 21 weeks long, split into three 7-week blocks. The first block is the lightest, with the more reps per set. The second block is a bit heavier. The last block is the heaviest, with the fewest reps per set. In the three strength programs, the final block should prepare you to test your 1RMs at the end of week 21 (the hypertrophy template, on the other hand, never gets heavier than 82.5% of 1RM for sets of 5-6+ reps, by default). All of these programs are autoregulated, meaning that in addition to programmed variations in intensity over time, your training maxes can also increase or decrease based on how you perform in your workouts.By default, the program employs full-body training to allow for a higher training frequency. Though the effect isn’t particularly large, higher frequencies may be a little better for both muscle growth and strength gains. Practically, higher frequencies also allow you to spread your training stress out a bit more, which can help you tolerate higher weekly training volumes and preserve training quality (i.e. 15 sets of squats in one training session would SUCK, but 5 sets in 3 separate sessions isn’t too bad, and will generally allow for higher average training quality). However, if you don’t like full-body workouts and you prefer slightly lower training frequencies, you should check out the lower frequency templates.

I honestly hate programming and periodization jargon, but enough people asked about this while these programs were in beta that I figure it’s worth writing: the default structure of the 21-week macrocycle takes a block periodization approach. Each 7-week meso-cycle employs a weekly undulating wave loading approach, with two 3-week waves followed by a deload (weeks 7, 14, and 21). Each training week employs a daily undulating programming approach, with core lifts (squat, bench, deadlift, and overhead press by default) trained at a higher intensity than auxiliary lifts. I felt dirty typing this paragraph. I hope you’re happy.

The novice programs, on the other hand, are open-ended. Rather than changing rep ranges and intensity zones week-to-week, you simply try to beat your prior performance each week. For the linear progression (strength program), that means going up in weight as you’re able. For the novice hypertrophy program, there are both volume and intensity progressions – you start with weights you can lift for 3 sets of 8 reps, add sets and reps in a controlled fashion until you’re performing 5 sets of 12 reps with the same weight, and then increase load.

To make my terminology clear regarding auxiliary and accessory exercises, when I refer to auxiliary lifts, I’m referring to close variations of your main lifts. These are bilateral lifts through a similar range of motion using a barbell or barbell-like implement (trap bar, safety squat bar, cambered bar, buffalo bar, etc.). Examples include paused squats, box squats, squats with accommodating resistance, close grip bench press, feet-up bench press, Spoto press, trap bar deadlift, deadlift with the opposite stance (sumo if you pull conventional, or conventional if you pull sumo), low block or rack pulls, push press, OHP with a log or axle, etc. When I refer to accessory lifts, I’m talking about everything else, including rows, pull-ups or pull-downs, single-joint exercises, dumbbell exercises, unilateral exercises, machine exercises, etc.

That’s probably enough of a general introduction. The next sections will walk you through how to set up and use each sheet. If there’s a particular program you know you want to use, feel free to skip ahead to the section for that program. However, if you want to use the program builder, you should at least skim the other sections so you understand how each progression scheme works.

# SBS Strength Program (normal and LF) {#sbs-strength-program-(normal-and-lf)}

	This is a 21-week program, split into three 7-week blocks. Each block increases in intensity (% of 1RM), while reps per set decrease. This program is based around completing sets until you reach a reps-in-reserve (RIR) target for each main exercise; if you complete fewer sets than the program calls for (4, by default) before reaching your RIR target, your training max will decrease. If you complete more sets than the program calls for (6, by default), your training max will increase.

	When you first open your copy of the SBS Strength Program spreadsheet, start on the “Quick Setup” tab. This is where you’ll set up your training cycle, and tailor the program to your needs and preferences. Throughout this entire spreadsheet, the blue cells can be edited, but I would strongly recommend not messing with any white cell that contains a formula.

	To start with, set your default rounding increment (Cells A1 and A2). This is the increment by which training loads can increase on this program. For example, if you train using pound plates, and the smallest plates you have are 2.5lb plates, the smallest weight increase you can use is a 5lb increase, so you’d set the rounding increment to “5”. If you’re using kilo plates, and you have 1.25kg plates, the smallest weight increase you can use is a 2.5kg increase, so you’d set the rounding increment to “2.5”. If you need to have multiple rounding increments (for example, if you’re doing some dumbbell exercises, and your dumbbells use different weight increments than your barbells), just set the rounding increment to “0.1” so you can do the rounding for yourself.

	Next, select the four main lifts you want to base your program around (C5-C8). By default, they’re squat, bench press, deadlift, and OHP. These are the four exercises that will be trained at slightly higher intensities than the rest of the lifts in the program. If you don’t want to use one (or more) of these exercises, feel free to sub them out with other core lifts you’d like to base your program around, or drop them altogether. For example, if you’re training for powerlifting, it may not be a bad idea to drop OHP; or if you’re a climber, it may not be a bad idea to sub out bench press for weighted pull-ups; or if you’re a strongman, it may not be a bad idea to sub out barbell OHP and deadlift for the DL and overhead variations that will be used at an upcoming competition.

	Next, select auxiliary lifts to complement your main exercises (C11-C16). By default, there are two squat auxiliary slots, two bench press auxiliary slots, one deadlift auxiliary slot, and one OHP auxiliary slot. Again, you can choose any lifts you want as auxiliaries; those are just the default recommendations. There are dropdown menus with options to choose from, but you can feel free to use exercises that aren’t included in the dropdown menus.



Next, fill in maxes for the main lifts and auxiliaries you choose (D5-D16). Whether you start with a conservative max or a true max is up to you. If you don’t know your 1RM for one of the lifts you selected, there’s no problem with just using a rough estimate. Since this program autoregulates training loads based on your performance, if you started with an estimate that’s too low, your training max will increase to an appropriate level soon; if you start with an overestimate, the program will automatically decrease your training max to an appropriate level after a couple of weeks.



As a note, if you decide to use weighted pull-ups or dips as a main exercise or auxiliary exercise, include both your bodyweight and attached weight when entering your 1RM (so, for example, if you weigh 100kg and you can do a pull-up with 50kg hanging from a belt, enter your 1RM as 150kg).

Next, if you want, you can edit the cells labeled “Single @8 percentage” (E5-E16). One way you can autoregulate using this program is by performing a heavy single at an RPE of 8 (2 reps in reserve) before your main work sets for each exercise (more on that later). In general, a single at 8RPE is typically about 90% of your true 1RM, which is why the cells are filled in with “90%” by default. However, if you know that, for example, a single at an 8RPE is closer to 93% of 1RM for your bench press and closer to 87% for your deadlift, you could edit the bench “Single @8 percentage” to be 93%, and the deadlift “Single @8 percentage” to be 87%.



	Next, you can determine your set thresholds for each exercise (H6-I15). In this program, your training maxes increase if you do more sets than the “upper threshold,” and decrease if you do fewer sets than the “lower threshold.” The set range is 4-6 by default, meaning that completing 3 or fewer sets for a given exercise would decrease your training max, and doing 7 or more would increase it. However, if you know you have better or worse strength endurance and/or recoverability for certain lifts, you could change these set thresholds. For example, if you know you can do a lot of sets of OHP, but only a few sets of deadlift before accumulating a lot of fatigue, you could set you “lower threshold” at 6 sets and your “upper threshold” at 8 sets for OHP, and also set your “lower threshold” at 3 sets and your “upper threshold” at 4 sets for deadlift.



	Next, you can determine how much your training maxes will increase when you exceed the upper set threshold, and how much your training maxes will decrease when you fall short of the lower set threshold (J6-K15). By default, training maxes increase by 2% when you exceed the upper threshold, and decrease by 5% if you fall below the lower threshold. However, if you’re a very advanced lifter and think 2% is too big of a jump if you exceed your upper set threshold, you could bump the increase down to 1%; conversely, if you’re a novice lifter who’s still making very rapid progress, you could increase the jump to 3% or 4% if you wanted to. If you want to change the degree to which your training max decreases if you fail to reach your lower set threshold, note that you need to make sure you enter a negative number.



	Next, if you want to enter some upper back exercises you like (for use in dropdown menus later), you can enter them in cells B19-D26. The ones currently entered in B19-B26 are just options that I think are good, but they’re not the only viable options by any means.



	Next, you can edit rep targets in the program in cells C34-W43. These cells show the amount of reps you’ll be doing with each percentage of 1RM in the program. If you know you have really good strength endurance with a particular lift, feel free to increase your per-set rep targets for that particular exercise; conversely, if you know you have poor strength endurance for another lift, you could decrease the per-set rep targets for that particular lift. You’ll notice that, in general, the rep targets are fairly low by default; that’s by design. The goal is to allow you to get in more high-quality sets, and to be able to generate fatigue by doing more sets (and thus having more opportunities to practice each lift) instead of pushing every set super close to failure.



	Next, you can edit your RIR cutoffs in the program in cells C48-W57. In this program, you do sets until you reach an RIR threshold. For example, if the RIR threshold is 2, you do sets with the prescribed amount of reps until you think you could only complete two more reps at the end of a set (if you were to push the set to failure). In other words, if you completed 5 reps, and you think you could have completed 7 reps (2 more), but probably not 8 reps, you had 2 RIR at the end of your set of 5; if your RIR threshold is 2, you’d use that as an indication that you should stop doing sets of your current exercise and move onto the next exercise in the program.

	By default, RIR thresholds are higher at lower percentages of 1RM, and lower at higher percentages of 1RM. That’s mostly to reflect the fact that training at lower percentages of 1RM causes more fatigue, all else being equal (e.g. proximity to failure). Anyone who’s done high rep squats to failure knows that. Since lower-intensity training is inherently more fatiguing, the RIR cutoffs are higher so you don’t end up pushing quite as close to failure (in an effort to mitigate fatigue to some degree). However, if you know that some particular lift does especially well for you when you train it close to failure, feel free to decrease the default RIR cutoffs; conversely, if you know you respond poorly when pushing close to failure, feel free to increase the default RIR cutoffs (especially with higher percentages of 1RM).



Finally, to finish up on the Quick Setup tab, you can edit the training intensity for each lift, each week (C61-W70). These are the cells that show the overall progression and structure in the default program. If you wanted to use a completely different training progression while employing the autoregulation features of this spreadsheet, however, you could change these intensity cells, and *voilà*: you have a new training program. Also feel free to stick with the default progression while making smaller tweaks. For example, if you know that some particular lift benefits from more lower-intensity training, you could decrease the intensities for that lift by 5-10%. Conversely, if you know that some particular lift languishes away if intensity is too low for too long, you could potentially bump the intensities in block 1 (weeks 1-7) up to match the intensities of block 2 (weeks 8-14).



Now, let’s move onto the Setup tab. The Setup tab simply takes all of the information in the Quick Setup tab and lays it out on a week-by-week basis. The Quick Setup tab is where you design the program, and the Setup tab is where you can make smaller tweaks once you start training. *Once you start the program, make ongoing changes in the Setup tab, rather than the Quick Setup tab.* Here are a few examples of tweaks you might make in the Setup tab:

1) If you’re coming back from a layoff, and you want to allow your training maxes to increase quickly while you’re retracing old ground, you may specify in the Quick Setup tab that your maxes will increase by 5% when you exceed your upper set thresholds. By week 9, your strength has mostly recovered, so progressing your training max by 5% per week is no longer feasible or advisable. So, for week 9 onward, you’d change the amount your training max would increase if you exceeded the upper set threshold back down to 1% or 2% (BK4-BK15, BR4-BR15, BY4-BY15, etc.).2) If you wanted to increase set volume block-to-block, you could do so in the Setup tab. For example, you could specify your lower set threshold as 3 sets and your upper threshold as 5 sets in the Quick Setup tab, and stick with those set thresholds for the first block of training (weeks 1-7). Then, in the Setup Tab, you could change your lower threshold to 4 and your upper threshold to 6 for the second block of training (weeks 8-14), and your lower threshold to 5 and your upper threshold to 7 for the third block of training (weeks 15-21).3) If you realize after week 4 that the RIR cutoffs are too high for a particular lift, you could change the RIR cutoffs for that particular lift in the Setup tab for weeks 5-21.

Below you can see how one week’s worth of program parameters looks in the Setup tab.



The next tab is the “Untouched” tab. You PROBABLY won’t need to use it. It’s for people who want to write their own program from scratch using the tools in this spreadsheet. The basic logic of this spreadsheet is that logic flows from the Quick Setup tab to the Setup tab to the sheets where you log your training (the ones labeled 2x-6x). However, the deload weeks in the default program – weeks 7, 14, and 21 – deviate from the logic in the Quick Setup and Setup tabs. Specifically, there’s no RIR target, and your training max doesn’t increase or decrease based on your performance during deloads. So, instead of pulling logic from the Setup tab, those weeks are “hard coded” into the 2x-6x sheets. Therefore, if you wanted to write a whole new program from scratch, certain things about weeks 7, 14, and 21 would screw up in the 2x-6x tabs. The Untouched tab, on the other hand, pulls logic directly from the Setup tab. So, you could write your own programming, and then cut and paste rows around in the Untouched tab to arrange the exercises the way you want them to be arranged.

The 2x-6x tabs are where you actually log your training. The 2x tab is for people who want to train twice per week, the 3x tab is for people who want to train three times per week, the 4x tab is for people who want to train four times per week, etc.

There are three major things to be aware of in whichever tab (training frequency) you choose.

First, there are hidden rows that contain your training maxes. Here’s how the first week on the 3x tab looks by default with training maxes hidden.



	You can see the arrows and the missing row numbers (4, 6, 8, 17, 19, 21, etc.) on the left hand side of that screenshot. Those are where the hidden rows are. If you click on the arrows, you’ll unhide the hidden rows. Here’s how the first week on the 3x tab looks with all of the hidden rows expanded:

	The numbers in the “TM” rows are your training maxes (for example, 490 for squat, 500 for sumo deadlift, 280 for incline press, etc.). Those are the numbers that increase or decrease based on the number of sets you complete week-to-week, and your working weights (342.5 for squat, 300 for sumo deadlift, 167.5 for incline press, etc.) are calculated based on those numbers. If you want to re-hide a training max row after expanding it, just right-click the row number, and select “hide row.”

	The second thing to be aware of is how to autoregulate daily training loads using singles at an 8RPE (2RIR). You certainly don’t have to do this, but *if* you want to work up to a heavy single before your main work sets, and you want to use that heavy single to update your training max (and thus your training loads in the current session), you’d fill in the weight you used for your heavy single at an 8RPE in the blue square in the “RIR cutoff” column, to the right of the text reading “single @8”.

For example, in the screenshots above, you can see that the training max for the squat is 490, and the weight to be used for the working sets is 342.5. However, if you worked up to a single at an 8RPE on squat during your first training session, and you hit 460, you could put 460 in the blue “single @8” cell, and it would update your training max. Assuming your “Single @8 percentage” from the Quick Setup tab was 90%, your new training max would be 511, and your new working weight would be 357.5.



	The third major thing to be aware of is how to move exercises around. If you don’t like the default training split and exercise orders, feel free to move exercises wherever you see fit. To do this, you have to CUT AND PASTE (not copy and paste) rows. First, expand the hidden rows with your training maxes. Next, add some additional rows to the spreadsheet so you have some room to work with. Then, just cut and paste rows wherever you want them to go until you have a training split that suits your preferences.

	To actually log your workouts, all you need to do is note the workout for the day (for example, by default, the first squat workout has you doing sets of 5 reps until you hit an RIR cutoff of 3RIR), complete it, and then log the number of sets completed in the “Sets completed” column. If you completed fewer sets than your bottom set threshold before hitting your RIR cutoff, your training max will decrease, and if you completed more sets than your upper set threshold, your training max will increase. The cells for notes and video links are purely for yourself. Filling in those cells or leaving them blank will not affect anything else in the spreadsheet.

	Below, you can see the effects of falling below the prescribed set range, falling within the prescribed set range, and exceeding the prescribed set range on your training max.





	Above each cell that reads “Accessories”, there’s a blue cell with a dropdown menu. This is where you can select upper back exercises. There’s a slot for upper back exercises in all workouts by default, but you don’t necessarily need to do upper back training in every workout if you don’t want to (2-3 times per week is probably sufficient).

Finally, the unfilled blue squares below “Accessories” are where you can add any other various exercises you want to perform. I’d recommend being judicious with accessories, and not proactively filling in all of the accessory slots simply because they exist. Be conscious about choosing accessories for specific weak points or muscle groups that aren’t already being trained heavily in the program.

For upper back training and accessories, the spreadsheet doesn’t come with a pre-specified progression scheme. Just fill in the weight, sets, and reps completed, and aim to improve your performances over time. The weights, sets, and reps you complete in one workout will auto-fill to the next workout, just so you have a handy record of the targets you’re trying to beat.

As previously mentioned, weeks 7, 14, and 21 are deloads, which is why the RIR cutoffs are listed as “n/a.” Just do 4-6 sets with the listed weights and move on. I’d also recommend taking it easier with your upper back training and accessories on deload week.

Near the end of the program, you *may* want to play things by ear, especially if you’re someone who recovers really well between sets, and your training max has maybe crept a bit too high. A few people have reported that week 19 is doable (singles at 90%) but week 20 (singles at 95%) is just too heavy. The goal of the last few weeks is to be ready to hit some big maxes at the end of week 21/start of week 22\. So, for week 20, feel free to go off-script and just work up to a “conservative max” – a weight that’s heavy, but you’re 100% sure you can hit. If you’ve competed in powerlifting before, it would be somewhere between a first attempt and a second attempt at a meet. For most people, the programmed 95% will be perfect, but don’t feel completely beholden to that number. Also, don’t worry too much about the sets/reps to failure/last set RIR goal; you’re at the end of the program, so if the sheet bumps your training max down, it won’t actually impact anything. You just want to get a few heavy reps in so that you’ll be ready for your upcoming maxes.

That’s about it\! Remember, for more tips, I’d strongly recommend skipping to the section at the end of this document.

# SBS Strength Program Last Set RIR (normal and LF) {#sbs-strength-program-last-set-rir-(normal-and-lf)}

This is a 21-week program, split into three 7-week blocks. Each block increases in intensity (% of 1RM), while reps per set decrease. This program is based around rating the difficulty of the final set for each main exercise you perform; if you have more reps in reserve (RIR) than the program calls for, your training max will increase. If you have fewer RIR on the last set than the program calls for, your training max will decrease.

	When you first open your copy of the “SBS Strength Program last set RIR” (henceforth referred to as “last set RIR”) spreadsheet, start on the “Quick Setup” tab. This is where you’ll set up your training cycle, and tailor the program to your needs and preferences. Throughout this entire spreadsheet, the blue cells can be edited, but I would strongly recommend not messing with any white cell that contains a formula.

	To start with, set your default rounding increment (Cells A1 and A2). This is the increment by which training loads can increase on this program. For example, if you train using pound plates, and the smallest plates you have are 2.5lb plates, the smallest weight increase you can use is a 5lb increase, so you’d set the rounding increment to “5”. If you’re using kilo plates, and you have 1.25kg plates, the smallest weight increase you can use is a 2.5kg increase, so you’d set the rounding increment to “2.5”. If you need to have multiple rounding increments (for example, if you’re doing some dumbbell exercises, and your dumbbells use different weight increments than your barbells), just set the rounding increment to “0.1” so you can do the rounding for yourself.



	Next, select the four main lifts you want to base your program around (C5-C8). By default, they’re squat, bench press, deadlift, and OHP. These are the four exercises that will be trained at slightly higher intensities than the rest of the lifts in the program. If you don’t want to use one (or more) of these exercises, feel free to sub them out with other core lifts you’d like to base your program around, or drop them altogether. For example, if you’re training for powerlifting, it may not be a bad idea to drop OHP; or if you’re a climber, it may not be a bad idea to sub out bench press for weighted pull-ups; or if you’re a strongman, it may not be a bad idea to to sub out barbell OHP and deadlift for the DL and overhead variations that will be used at an upcoming competition.



	Next, select auxiliary lifts to complement your main exercises (C11-C16). By default, there are two squat auxiliary slots, two bench press auxiliary slots, one deadlift auxiliary slot, and one OHP auxiliary slot. Again, you can choose any lifts you want as auxiliaries; those are just the default recommendations. There are dropdown menus with options to choose from, but you can feel free to use exercises that aren’t included in the dropdown menus.



Next, fill in maxes for the main lifts and auxiliaries you choose (D5-D16). Whether you start with a conservative max or a true max is up to you. If you don’t know your 1RM for one of the lifts you selected, there’s no problem with just using a rough estimate. Since this program autoregulates training loads based on your performance, if you started with an estimate that’s too low, your training max will increase to an appropriate level soon; if you start with an overestimate, the program will automatically decrease your training max to an appropriate level after a couple of weeks.



As a note, if you decide to use weighted pull-ups or dips as a main exercise or auxiliary exercise, include both your bodyweight and attached weight when entering your 1RM (so, for example, if you weigh 100kg and you can do a pull-up with 50kg hanging from a belt, enter your 1RM as 150kg).

Next, if you want, you can edit the cells labeled “Single @8 percentage” (E5-E16). One way you can autoregulate using this program is by performing a heavy single at an RPE of 8 (2 reps in reserve) before your main work sets for each exercise (more on that later). In general, a single at 8RPE is typically about 90% of your true 1RM, which is why the cells are filled in with “90%” by default. However, if you know that, for example, a single at an 8RPE is closer to 93% of 1RM for your bench press and closer to 87% for your deadlift, you could edit the bench “Single @8 percentage” to be 93%, and the deadlift “Single @8 percentage” to be 87%.



	Next, you can determine how many sets to perform for each exercise (H6-H15). In this program, you perform 5 sets per exercise by default. However, if you know you have better or worse strength endurance and/or recoverability for certain lifts, you could change these set thresholds. For example, if you know you can do a lot of sets of OHP, but only a few sets of deadlift before accumulating a lot of fatigue, you could adjust “sets” up to 7 to OHP and down to 3 for deadlift.



	Next, you can determine how much your training maxes will increase when you exceed your RIR target, and how much your training maxes will decrease when you fall short of your RIR target (I6-P15). By default, training maxes decrease considerably if you fail to complete all of your prescribed sets, decrease a bit if you complete all of the prescribed sets but have fewer RIR after the last set than your RIR target, increase a little bit if you have 1-2 more RIR after the last set than your RIR target, and increase by a lot if you have way more RIR after the last set than your RIR target. However, if you’re a very advanced lifter and think the jumps are too big when you exceed your RIR target, you could bump the increases down a bit; conversely, if you’re a novice lifter who’s still making very rapid progress, you could increase the training max jumps if you wanted. If you want to change the degree to which your training max decreases if you fail to complete the target number of sets or have fewer RIR after the last set than your RIR target, note that you need to make sure you enter a negative number.



	Next, if you want to enter some upper back exercises you like (for use in dropdown menus later), you can enter them in cells B19-D26. The ones currently entered in B19-B26 are just options that I think are good, but they’re not the only viable options by any means.



	Next, you can edit rep targets in the program in cells C32-W41. These cells show the amount of reps you’ll be doing with each percentage of 1RM in the program. If you know you have really good strength endurance with a particular lift, feel free to increase your per-set rep targets for that particular exercise; conversely, if you know you have poor strength endurance for another lift, you could decrease the per-set rep targets for that particular lift. You’ll notice that, in general, the rep targets are fairly low by default; that’s by design. The goal is to allow you to get in a fair amount of high-quality sets, instead of making you crank out grinders from set 1\. In general, the first few weeks will probably be pretty easy on this program, and the training will get more challenging as your training maxes increase.



	Next, you can edit your RIR targets in the program in cells C46-W55. In this program, you rate your RIR after the last set of each exercise, and your training max increases or decreases based on whether you had more or fewer RIR than the RIR target. For example, if you’re supposed to do 5 sets of 5 squats, you do the 5 sets and then assess your RIR after the last rep of the last set. If, after the fifth rep, you’re pretty sure you could have done 8 reps, but probably not a ninth, you’d record 3 RIR (you did 5 and you could have done 8, so you had 3 reps in reserve). If your RIR target for the workout was 2, your RIR exceeded the target RIR, so your training max would increase.

	By default, RIR targets are higher at lower percentages of 1RM, and lower at higher percentages of 1RM. That’s mostly to reflect the fact that training at lower percentages of 1RM causes more fatigue, all else being equal (e.g. proximity to failure). Anyone who’s done high rep squats to failure knows that. Since lower-intensity training is inherently more fatiguing, the RIR targets are higher so you generally don’t end up pushing quite as close to failure (in an effort to mitigate fatigue to some degree). However, if you know that some particular lift does especially well for you when you train it close to failure, feel free to decrease the default RIR targets; conversely, if you know you respond poorly when pushing close to failure, feel free to increase the default RIR targets (especially with higher percentages of 1RM).



Finally, to finish up on the Quick Setup tab, you can edit the training intensity for each lift, each week (C60-W69). These are the cells that show the overall progression and structure in the default program. If you wanted to use a completely different training progression while employing the autoregulation features of this spreadsheet, however, you could change these intensity cells, and *voilà*: you have a new training program. Also feel free to stick with the default progression while making smaller tweaks. For example, if you know that some particular lift benefits from more lower-intensity training, you could decrease the intensities for that lift by 5-10%. Conversely, if you know that some particular lift languishes away if intensity is too low for too long, you could potentially bump the intensities in block 1 (weeks 1-7) up to match the intensities of block 2 (weeks 8-14).



Now, let’s move onto the Setup tab. The Setup tab simply takes all of the information in the Quick Setup tab and lays it out on a week-by-week basis. The Quick Setup tab is where you design the program, and the Setup tab is where you can make smaller tweaks once you start training. *Once you start the program, make ongoing changes in the Setup tab, rather than the Quick Setup tab.* Here are a few examples of tweaks you might make in the Setup tab:

1) If you’re coming back from a layoff, and you want to allow your training maxes to increase quickly while you’re retracing old ground, you may specify in the Quick Setup tab that your maxes will increase by a larger percentage when you exceed your RIR targets. By week 9, your strength has mostly recovered, so progressing your training max so quickly is no longer feasible or advisable. So, for week 9 onward, you’d change the amount your training max would increase if you exceeded your RIR target back down to the default values (DA3-DE14, DM3-DQ14, DY3-EC14, etc.).2) If you wanted to increase set volume block-to-block, you could do so in the Setup tab. For example, you could specify that you’re doing 4 sets per exercise in the Quick Setup tab, and stick with those set thresholds for the first block of training (weeks 1-7). Then, in the Setup Tab, you could change your “sets” to 5 for the second block of training (weeks 8-14), and change your “sets” to 6 for the third block of training (weeks 15-21).3) If you realize after week 4 that the RIR targets are too high for a particular lift, you could change the RIR cutoffs for that particular lift in the Setup tab for weeks 5-21.

Below you can see how one week’s worth of program parameters looks in the Setup tab.



The next tab is the “Untouched” tab. You PROBABLY won’t need to use it. It’s for people who want to write their own program from scratch using the tools in this spreadsheet. The basic logic of this spreadsheet is that logic flows from the Quick Setup tab to the Setup tab to the sheets where you log your training (the ones labeled 2x-6x). However, the deload weeks in the default program – weeks 7, 14, and 21 – deviate from the logic in the Quick Setup and Setup tabs. Specifically, there’s no RIR target, and your training max doesn’t increase or decrease based on your performance during deloads. So, instead of pulling logic from the Setup tab, those weeks are “hard coded” into the 2x-6x sheets. Therefore, if you wanted to write a whole new program from scratch, certain things about weeks 7, 14, and 21 would screw up in the 2x-6x tabs. The Untouched tab, on the other hand, pulls logic directly from the Setup tab. So, you could write your own programming, and then cut and paste rows around in the Untouched tab to arrange the exercises the way you want them to be arranged.

The 2x-6x tabs are where you actually log your training. The 2x tab is for people who want to train twice per week, the 3x tab is for people who want to train three times per week, the 4x tab is for people who want to train four times per week, etc.

There are three major things to be aware of in whichever tab (training frequency) you choose.

First, there are hidden rows that contain your training maxes. Here’s how the first week on the 3x tab looks by default with training maxes hidden.



	You can see the arrows and the missing row numbers (4, 6, 8, 17, 19, 21, etc.) on the left hand side of that screenshot. Those are where the hidden rows are. If you click on the arrows, you’ll unhide the hidden rows. Here’s how the first week on the 3x tab looks with all of the hidden rows expanded:

	The numbers in the “TM” rows are your training maxes (for example, 490 for squat, 500 for sumo deadlift, 280 for incline press, etc.). Those are the numbers that increase or decrease based on the degree to which you exceed or fall short of your last set RIR target week-to-week, and your working weights (342.5 for squat, 300 for sumo deadlift, 167.5 for incline press, etc.) are calculated based on those numbers. If you want to re-hide a training max row after expanding it, just right-click the row number, and select “hide row.”

	The second thing to be aware of is how to autoregulate daily training loads using singles at an 8RPE (2RIR). You certainly don’t have to do this, but *if* you want to work up to a heavy single before your main work sets, and you want to use that heavy single to update your training max (and thus your training loads in the current session), you’d fill in the weight you used for your heavy single at an 8RPE in the blue square in the “Last set RIR target” column, to the right of the text reading “single @8”.

For example, in the screenshots above, you can see that the training max for the squat is 490, and the weight to be used for the working sets is 342.5. However, if you worked up to a single at an 8RPE on squat during your first training session, and you hit 460, you could put 460 in the blue “single @8” cell, and it would update your training max. Assuming your “Single @8 percentage” from the Quick Setup tab was 90%, your new training max would be 511, and your new working weight would be 357.5.



	The third major thing to be aware of is how to move exercises around. If you don’t like the default training split and exercise orders, feel free to move exercises wherever you see fit. To do this, you have to CUT AND PASTE (not copy and paste) rows. First, expand the hidden rows with your training maxes. Next, add some additional rows to the spreadsheet so you have some room to work with. Then, just cut and paste rows wherever you want them to go until you have a training split that suits your preferences.

	To actually log your workouts, all you need to do is note the workout for the day (for example, by default, the first squat workout has you doing 5 sets of 5 reps), complete it, and then log the number of sets completed in the “Sets completed” column, and your actual RIR on the last set in the “RIR on last set” column. If you completed fewer sets than were prescribed, your training max will decrease considerably. If you completed the prescribed number of sets, and your actual RIR matched the workout’s RIR target, your training max won’t change. If you had more RIR than the RIR target, your training max will increase (by a little bit if your actual RIR were barely greater than the RIR target, and by more if your actual RIR were considerably greater than the RIR target). The cells for notes and video links are purely for yourself. Filling in those cells or leaving them blank will not affect anything else in the spreadsheet.

	Below, you can see the effects of failing to reach your set target, hitting your set target and having RIR that match the target RIR for the day, barely exceeding the day’s RIR target, and considerably exceeding the RIR target.



	Now, one drawback worth noting is that most people’s ability to accurately rate RIRs drops off after \~4 or 5\. If a workout is quite easy, and you have more than 4-5 RIR on the last set, don’t worry about the “RIR on last set” that you enter too terribly much. If a workout is that easy, it means your training max needs to be bumped up considerably, so if you fill in an RIR number that’s a bit too high, the increase in training weights probably won’t be so great that the next workout becomes too challenging. And conversely, if you actually had 8 RIR, but you underestimated your RIR and said you had 6 RIR instead, it’ll still bump your training max up by a decent chunk. The net effect would be that your training maxes might take an extra week or two to drift up to where they “should” be, but it’s not like the workouts would be so light in the meantime that they’d be unproductive. Basically, autoregulation will naturally sort out load assignment over time, unless your RIR estimates are just tragically bad.

	Above each cell that reads “Accessories”, there’s a blue cell with a dropdown menu. This is where you can select upper back exercises. There’s a slot for upper back exercises in all workouts by default, but you don’t necessarily need to do upper back training in every workout if you don’t want to (2-3 times per week is probably sufficient).



Finally, the unfilled blue squares below “Accessories” are where you can add any other various exercises you want to perform. I’d recommend being judicious with accessories, and not proactively filling in all of the accessory slots simply because they exist. Be conscious about choosing accessories for specific weak points or muscle groups that aren’t already being trained heavily in the program.

For upper back training and accessories, the spreadsheet doesn’t come with a pre-specified progression scheme. Just fill in the weight, sets, and reps completed, and aim to improve your performances over time. The weights, sets, and reps you complete in one workout will auto-fill to the next workout, just so you have a handy record of the targets you’re trying to beat.

As previously mentioned, weeks 7, 14, and 21 are deloads, which is why the RIR targets are listed as “n/a.” Just do 5 sets with the listed weights and move on. I’d also recommend taking it easier with your upper back training and accessories on deload week.

Near the end of the program, you *may* want to play things by ear, especially if you’re someone who recovers really well between sets, and your training max has maybe crept a bit too high. A few people have reported that week 19 is doable (singles at 90%) but week 20 (singles at 95%) is just too heavy. The goal of the last few weeks is to be ready to hit some big maxes at the end of week 21/start of week 22\. So, for week 20, feel free to go off-script and just work up to a “conservative max” – a weight that’s heavy, but you’re 100% sure you can hit. If you’ve competed in powerlifting before, it would be somewhere between a first attempt and a second attempt at a meet. For most people, the programmed 95% will be perfect, but don’t feel completely beholden to that number. Also, don’t worry too much about the last set RIR goal; you’re at the end of the program, so if the sheet bumps your training max down, it won’t actually impact anything. You just want to get a few heavy reps in so that you’ll be ready for your upcoming maxes.

That’s about it\! Remember, for more tips, I’d strongly recommend skipping to the section at the end of this document.

# SBS Strength Program Last Set Reps To Failure (normal and LF) {#sbs-strength-program-last-set-reps-to-failure-(normal-and-lf)}

This is a 21-week program, split into three 7-week blocks. Each block increases in intensity (% of 1RM), while reps per set decrease. This program is based around matching or beating rep targets when performing a final set to failure for each main (core and auxiliary) lift in each workout; if you beat the rep target on the final set of each exercise, your training max will increase, if you hit the rep target, your training max will stay the same, and if you fall short of the rep target, your training max will decrease.

	When you first open your copy of the “SBS Strength Program reps to failure” (henceforth referred to as “RTF”) spreadsheet, start on the “Quick Setup” tab. This is where you’ll set up your training cycle, and tailor the program to your needs and preferences. Throughout this entire spreadsheet, the blue cells can be edited, but I would strongly recommend not messing with any white cell that contains a formula.

	To start with, set your default rounding increment (Cells A1 and A2). This is the increment by which training loads can increase on this program. For example, if you train using pound plates, and the smallest plates you have are 2.5lb plates, the smallest weight increase you can use is a 5lb increase, so you’d set the rounding increment to “5”. If you’re using kilo plates, and you have 1.25kg plates, the smallest weight increase you can use is a 2.5kg increase, so you’d set the rounding increment to “2.5”. If you need to have multiple rounding increments (for example, if you’re doing some dumbbell exercises, and your dumbbells use different weight increments than your barbells), just set the rounding increment to “0.1” so you can do the rounding for yourself.



	Next, select the four main lifts you want to base your program around (C5-C8). By default, they’re squat, bench press, deadlift, and OHP. These are the four exercises that will be trained at slightly higher intensities than the rest of the lifts in the program. If you don’t want to use one (or more) of these exercises, feel free to sub them out with other core lifts you’d like to base your program around, or drop them altogether. For example, if you’re training for powerlifting, it may not be a bad idea to drop OHP, or if you’re a climber, it may not be a bad idea to sub out bench press for weighted pull-ups, or if you’re a strongman, it may not be a bad idea to to sub out barbell OHP and deadlift for the DL and overhead variations that will be used at an upcoming competition.



	Next, select auxiliary lifts to complement your main exercises (C11-C16). By default, there are two squat auxiliary slots, two bench press auxiliary slots, one deadlift auxiliary slot, and one OHP auxiliary slot. Again, you can choose any lifts you want as auxiliaries; those are just the default recommendations. There are dropdown menus with options to choose from, but you can feel free to use exercises that aren’t included in the dropdown menus.



Next, fill in maxes for the main lifts and auxiliaries you choose (D5-D16). Whether you start with a conservative max or a true max is up to you. If you don’t know your 1RM for one of the lifts you selected, there’s no problem with just using a rough estimate. Since this program autoregulates training loads based on your performance, if you started with an estimate that’s too low, your training max will increase to an appropriate level soon; if you start with an overestimate, the program will automatically decrease your training max to an appropriate level after a couple of weeks.



As a note, if you decide to use weighted pull-ups or dips as a main exercise or auxiliary exercise, include both your bodyweight and attached weight when entering your 1RM (so, for example, if you weigh 100kg and you can do a pull-up with 50kg hanging from a belt, enter your 1RM as 150kg).

Next, if you want, you can edit the cells labeled “Single @8 percentage” (E5-E16). One way you can autoregulate using this program is by performing a heavy single at an RPE of 8 (2 reps in reserve) before your main work sets for each exercise (more on that later). In general, a single at 8RPE is typically about 90% of your true 1RM, which is why the cells are filled in with “90%” by default. However, if you know that, for example, a single at an 8RPE is closer to 93% of 1RM for your bench press and closer to 87% for your deadlift, you could edit the bench “Single @8 percentage” to be 93%, and the deadlift “Single @8 percentage” to be 87%.



	Next, you can determine how many sets to perform for each exercise (H6-H15). In this program, you perform 5 sets per exercise by default. However, if you know you have better or worse strength endurance and/or recoverability for certain lifts, you could change these set thresholds. For example, if you know you can do a lot of sets of OHP, but only a few sets of deadlift before accumulating a lot of fatigue, you could adjust “sets” up to 7 to OHP and down to 3 for deadlift.



	Next, you can determine how much your training maxes will increase when you exceed your reps to failure target, and how much your training maxes will decrease when you fall short of your reps to failure target (I6-P15). By default, training maxes decrease considerably if you fall 2+ reps short of your RTF target, decrease a bit if you fall one rep short of your RTF target, increase a little bit if your beat your RTF target by a rep or two, and increase by a lot if you beat your RTF target by a lot. However, if you’re a very advanced lifter and think the jumps are too big when you exceed your RTF target, you could bump the increases down a bit; conversely, if you’re a novice lifter who’s still making very rapid progress, you could increase the training max jumps if you wanted. If you want to change the degree to which your training max decreases if you fall short of your RTF target, note that you need to make sure you enter a negative number.



	Next, if you want to enter some upper back exercises you like (for use in dropdown menus later), you can enter them in cells B19-D26. The ones currently entered in B19-B26 are just options that I think are good, but they’re not the only viable options by any means.



	Next, you can edit normal set rep targets (e.g. for sets not taken to failure; your first 4 sets of each exercise, by default) in the program in cells C32-W41. These cells show the amount of reps you’ll be doing on non-failure sets with each percentage of 1RM in the program. If you know you have really good strength endurance with a particular lift, feel free to increase your per-set rep targets for that particular exercise; conversely, if you know you have poor strength endurance for another lift, you could decrease the per-set rep targets for that particular lift. You’ll notice that, in general, the rep targets are fairly low by default; that’s by design. The goal is to allow you to get in a fair amount of high-quality sets, instead of making you crank out grinders from set 1\.



	Next, you can edit your last set rep targets in the program in cells C46-W55. In this program, you take the last set to failure, and your training max increases or decreases based on whether you exceed or fall short of your rep target on the final set. For example, if you’re supposed to do 5 sets of squats with 5 reps on normal sets and 10 reps as your last set target, you’d perform 4 sets of 5 reps, and then one set to failure. If you get more than 10 reps on the last set, your training max will increase; if you get fewer than 10 reps, your training max will decrease.

	By default, last set rep targets are higher at lower intensities, lower at higher intensities, and the same for every lift. However, if you know that you have great strength endurance for a particular lift, you may want to increase the rep targets for that exercise, and if you know you have poor strength endurance for another lift, you may want to decrease the rep targets for that exercise.



Finally, to finish up on the Quick Setup tab, you can edit the training intensity for each lift, each week (C60-W69). These are the cells that show the overall progression and structure in the default program. If you wanted to use a completely different training progression while employing the autoregulation features of this spreadsheet, however, you could change these intensity cells, and *voilà*: you have a new training program. Also feel free to stick with the default progression while making smaller tweaks. For example, if you know that some particular lift benefits from more lower-intensity training, you could decrease the intensities for that lift by 5-10%. Conversely, if you know that some particular lift languishes away if intensity is too low for too long, you could potentially bump the intensities in block 1 (weeks 1-7) up to match the intensities of block 2 (weeks 8-14).



Now, let’s move onto the Setup tab. The Setup tab simply takes all of the information in the Quick Setup tab and lays it out on a week-by-week basis. The Quick Setup tab is where you design the program, and the Setup tab is where you can make smaller tweaks once you start training. *Once you start the program, make ongoing changes in the Setup tab, rather than the Quick Setup tab.* Here are a few examples of tweaks you might make in the Setup tab:

1) If you’re coming back from a layoff, and you want to allow your training maxes to increase quickly while you’re retracing old ground, you may specify in the Quick Setup tab that your maxes will increase by a larger percentage when you exceed your rep out targets. By week 9, your strength has mostly recovered, so progressing your training max so quickly is no longer feasible or advisable. So, for week 9 onward, you’d change the amount your training max would increase if you exceeded your RIR target back down to the default values (DA3-DE14, DM3-DQ14, DY3-EC14, etc.).2) If you wanted to increase set volume block-to-block, you could do so in the Setup tab. For example, you could specify that you’re doing 4 sets per exercise in the Quick Setup tab, and stick with those set thresholds for the first block of training (weeks 1-7). Then, in the Setup Tab, you could change your “sets” to 5 for the second block of training (weeks 8-14), and change your “sets” to 6 for the third block of training (weeks 15-21).3) If you realize after week 4 that the RTF (last set rep) targets are too high for a particular lift, you could change the rep out targets for that particular lift in the Setup tab for weeks 5-21.

Below you can see how one week’s worth of program parameters looks in the Setup tab.



The next tab is the “Untouched” tab. You PROBABLY won’t need to use it. It’s for people who want to write their own program from scratch using the tools in this spreadsheet. The basic logic of this spreadsheet is that logic flows from the Quick Setup tab to the Setup tab to the sheets where you log your training (the ones labeled 2x-6x). However, the deload weeks in the default program – weeks 7, 14, and 21 – deviate from the logic in the Quick Setup and Setup tabs. Specifically, there’s no RIR target, and your training max doesn’t increase or decrease based on your performance during deloads. So, instead of pulling logic from the Setup tab, those weeks are “hard coded” into the 2x-6x sheets. Therefore, if you wanted to write a whole new program from scratch, certain things about weeks 7, 14, and 21 would screw up in the 2x-6x tabs. The Untouched tab, on the other hand, pulls logic directly from the Setup tab. So, you could write your own programming, and then cut and paste rows around in the Untouched tab to arrange the exercises the way you want them to be arranged.

The 2x-6x tabs are where you actually log your training. The 2x tab is for people who want to train twice per week, the 3x tab is for people who want to train three times per week, the 4x tab is for people who want to train four times per week, etc.

There are three major things to be aware of in whichever tab (training frequency) you choose.

First, there are hidden rows that contain your training maxes. Here’s how the first week on the 3x tab looks by default with training maxes hidden.



	You can see the arrows and the missing row numbers (4, 6, 8, 17, 19, 21, etc.) on the left hand side of that screenshot. Those are where the hidden rows are. If you click on the arrows, you’ll unhide the hidden rows. Here’s how the first week on the 3x tab looks with all of the hidden rows expanded:



	The numbers in the “TM” rows are your training maxes (for example, 490 for squat, 500 for sumo deadlift, 280 for incline press, etc.). Those are the numbers that increase or decrease based on the degree to which you exceed or fall short of your RTF target week-to-week, and your working weights (342.5 for squat, 300 for sumo deadlift, 167.5 for incline press, etc.) are calculated based on those numbers. If you want to re-hide a training max row after expanding it, just right-click the row number, and select “hide row.”

	The second thing to be aware of is how to autoregulate daily training loads using singles at an 8RPE (2RIR). You certainly don’t have to do this, but *if* you want to work up to a heavy single before your main work sets, and you want to use that heavy single to update your training max (and thus your training loads in the current session), you’d fill in the weight you used for your heavy single at an 8RPE in the blue square in the “rep out target” column, to the right of the text reading “single @8”.

For example, in the screenshots above, you can see that the training max for the squat is 490, and the weight to be used for the working sets is 342.5. However, if you worked up to a single at an 8RPE on squat during your first training session, and you hit 460, you could put 460 in the blue “single @8” cell, and it would update your training max. Assuming your “Single @8 percentage” from the Quick Setup tab was 90%, your new training max would be 511, and your new working weight would be 357.5.



	The third major thing to be aware of is how to move exercises around. If you don’t like the default training split and exercise orders, feel free to move exercises wherever you see fit. To do this, you have to CUT AND PASTE (not copy and paste) rows. First, expand the hidden rows with your training maxes. Next, add some additional rows to the spreadsheet so you have some room to work with. Then, just cut and paste rows wherever you want them to go until you have a training split that suits your preferences.

	To actually log your workouts, all you need to do is note the workout for the day (for example, by default, the first squat workout has you doing 4 sets of 5 reps, and one set to failure), complete it, and then log the number of reps you completed on your last set in the “reps on last set” column. If you completed fewer reps than your rep out target, your training max will decrease. If you hit the rep out target on the head, your training max won’t change. If you beat the rep out target on the last set, your training max will increase (by a little bit if you beat the rep out target by a little, and by a lot if you beat the rep out target by a lot). The cells for notes and video links are purely for yourself. Filling in those cells or leaving them blank will not affect anything else in the spreadsheet.

	Below, you can see the effects of falling short of your rep out target, hitting your rep out target, beating your rep out target by a little bit, and beating your rep out target by a lot.



	Above each cell that reads “Accessories”, there’s a blue cell with a dropdown menu. This is where you can select upper back exercises. There’s a slot for upper back exercises in all workouts by default, but you don’t necessarily need to do upper back training in every workout if you don’t want to (2-3 times per week is probably sufficient).



Finally, the unfilled blue squares below “Accessories” are where you can add any other various exercises you want to perform. I’d recommend being judicious with accessories, and not proactively filling in all of the accessory slots simply because they exist. Be conscious about choosing accessories for specific weak points or muscle groups that aren’t already being trained heavily in the program.

For upper back training and accessories, the spreadsheet doesn’t come with a pre-specified progression scheme. Just fill in the weight, sets, and reps completed, and aim to improve your performances over time. The weights, sets, and reps you complete in one workout will auto-fill to the next workout, just so you have a handy record of the targets you’re trying to beat.

As previously mentioned, weeks 7, 14, and 21 are deloads, which is why the rep out targets are listed as “n/a.” Just do 5 sets with the listed weights and move on. I’d also recommend taking it easier with your upper back training and accessories on deload week.

Near the end of the program, you *may* want to play things by ear, especially if you’re someone who recovers really well between sets, and your training max has maybe crept a bit too high. A few people have reported that week 19 is doable (singles at 90%) but week 20 (singles at 95%) is just too heavy. The goal of the last few weeks is to be ready to hit some big maxes at the end of week 21/start of week 22\. So, for week 20, feel free to go off-script and just work up to a “conservative max” – a weight that’s heavy, but you’re 100% sure you can hit. If you’ve competed in powerlifting before, it would be somewhere between a first attempt and a second attempt at a meet. For most people, the programmed 95% will be perfect, but don’t feel completely beholden to that number. Also, don’t worry too much about the last set RIR goal; you’re at the end of the program, so if the sheet bumps your training max down, it won’t actually impact anything. You just want to get a few heavy reps in so that you’ll be ready for your upcoming maxes.

That’s about it\! Remember, for more tips, I’d strongly recommend skipping to the section at the end of this document.

# SBS Hypertrophy Template (normal and LF) {#sbs-hypertrophy-template-(normal-and-lf)}

This is a 21-week program, split into three 7-week blocks. Each block increases in intensity (% of 1RM), while reps per set decrease (though not to the same extent as the strength-focused programs). This program is based around matching or beating rep targets when performing a final set to failure for each main (core and auxiliary) lift in each workout; if you beat the rep target on the final set of each exercise, your training max will increase, if you hit the rep target, your training max will stay the same, and if you fall short of the rep target, your training max will decrease.

	When you first open your copy of the “SBS Hypertrophy Template” spreadsheet, start on the “Quick Setup” tab. This is where you’ll set up your training cycle, and tailor the program to your needs and preferences. Throughout this entire spreadsheet, the blue cells can be edited, but I would strongly recommend not messing with any white cell that contains a formula.

	To start with, set your default rounding increment (Cells A1 and A2). This is the increment by which training loads can increase on this program. For example, if you train using pound plates, and the smallest plates you have are 2.5lb plates, the smallest weight increase you can use is a 5lb increase, so you’d set the rounding increment to “5”. If you’re using kilo plates, and you have 1.25kg plates, the smallest weight increase you can use is a 2.5kg increase, so you’d set the rounding increment to “2.5”. If you need to have multiple rounding increments (for example, if you’re doing some dumbbell exercises, and your dumbbells use different weight increments than your barbells), just set the rounding increment to “0.1” so you can do the rounding for yourself.



	Next, select the four main lifts you want to base your program around (C5-C8). By default, they’re squat, bench press, block pull, and OHP (note: I subbed in block pulls in place of deadlifts a few months after initially writing the instructions, since they should train the upper back a bit harder for hypertrophy, while causing a bit less low back fatigue). These are the four exercises that will be trained at slightly higher intensities than the rest of the lifts in the program. If you don’t want to use one (or more) of these exercises, feel free to sub them out with other core lifts you’d like to base your program around, or drop them altogether. For example, lots of people are fans of DB bench press for pec hypertrophy and RDLs for posterior chain hypertrophy; it would be perfectly fine to sub out bench press for DB bench or deadlifts for RDLs.



	Next, select auxiliary lifts to complement your main exercises (C11-C16). By default, there are two squat auxiliary slots, two bench press auxiliary slots, one deadlift auxiliary slot, and one OHP auxiliary slot. Again, you can choose any lifts you want as auxiliaries; those are just the default options. There are dropdown menus with options to choose from, but you can feel free to use exercises that aren’t included in the dropdown menus.



Next, fill in maxes for the main lifts and auxiliaries you choose (D5-D16). This program is pretty tough, so I’d **strongly** recommend starting with conservative training maxes. If you don’t know your 1RM for one of the lifts you selected, there’s no problem with just using a rough estimate. Since this program autoregulates training loads based on your performance, if you started with an estimate that’s too low, your training max will increase to an appropriate level soon; if you start with an overestimate, the program will automatically decrease your training max to an appropriate level after a couple of weeks.



As a note, if you decide to use weighted pull-ups or dips as a main exercise or auxiliary exercise, include both your bodyweight and attached weight when entering your 1RM (so, for example, if you weigh 100kg and you can do a pull-up with 50kg hanging from a belt, enter your 1RM as 150kg).

Next, if you want, you can edit the cells labeled “Single @8 percentage” (E5-E16). One way you can autoregulate using this program is by performing a heavy single at an RPE of 8 (2 reps in reserve) before your main work sets for each exercise (more on that later). In general, a single at 8RPE is typically about 90% of your true 1RM, which is why the cells are filled in with “90%” by default. However, if you know that, for example, a single at an 8RPE is closer to 93% of 1RM for your bench press and closer to 87% for your deadlift, you could edit the bench “Single @8 percentage” to be 93%, and the deadlift “Single @8 percentage” to be 87%.



	Next, you can determine how many sets to perform for each exercise (H6-H15). In this program, you perform 4 sets per exercise by default. However, if you know you have better or worse strength endurance and/or recoverability for certain lifts, you could change these set thresholds. For example, if you know you can do a lot of sets of OHP, but only a few sets of deadlift before accumulating a lot of fatigue, you could adjust “sets” up to 6 to OHP and down to 3 for deadlift.



	Next, you can determine how much your training maxes will increase when you exceed your reps to failure target, and how much your training maxes will decrease when you fall short of your reps to failure target (I6-P15). By default, training maxes decrease considerably if you fall 2+ reps short of your RTF target, decrease a bit if you fall one rep short of your RTF target, increase a little bit if your beat your RTF target by a rep or two, and increase by a lot if you beat your RTF target by a lot. However, if you’re a very advanced lifter and think the jumps are too big when you exceed your RTF target, you could bump the increases down a bit; conversely, if you’re a novice lifter who’s still making very rapid progress, you could increase the training max jumps if you wanted. If you want to change the degree to which your training max decreases if you fall short of your RTF target, note that you need to make sure you enter a negative number.



	Next, if you want to enter some upper back exercises you like (for use in dropdown menus later), you can enter them in cells B19-D26. The ones currently entered in B19-B26 are just options that I think are good, but they’re not the only viable options by any means.



	Next, you can edit normal set rep targets (e.g. for sets not taken to failure; your first 3 sets of each exercise, by default) in the program in cells C32-W41. These cells show the amount of reps you’ll be doing on non-failure sets with each percentage of 1RM in the program. If you know you have really good strength endurance with a particular lift, feel free to increase your per-set rep targets for that particular exercise; conversely, if you know you have poor strength endurance for another lift, you could decrease the per-set rep targets for that particular lift. You’ll notice that, in general, the rep targets are relatively high by default. Since you likely need to be at least reasonably close to failure to maximize your per-set hypertrophy stimulus, this program is designed so that all sets should be at least reasonably challenging.



	Next, you can edit your last set rep targets in the program in cells C46-W55. In this program, you take the last set to failure, and your training max increases or decreases based on whether you exceed or fall short of your rep target on the final set. For example, if you’re supposed to do 4 sets of squats with 10 reps on normal sets and 12 reps as your last set target, you’d perform 3 sets of 10 reps, and then one set to failure. If you get more than 12 reps on the last set, your training max will increase; if you get fewer than 12 reps, your training max will decrease.

	By default, last set rep targets are higher at lower intensities, lower at higher intensities, and the same for every lift. However, if you know that you have great strength endurance for a particular lift, you may want to increase the rep targets for that exercise, and if you know you have poor strength endurance for another lift, you may want to decrease the rep targets for that exercise.



Finally, to finish up on the Quick Setup tab, you can edit the training intensity for each lift, each week (C60-W69). These are the cells that show the overall progression and structure in the default program. If you wanted to use a completely different training progression while employing the autoregulation features of this spreadsheet, however, you could change these intensity cells, and *voilà*: you have a new training program. Also feel free to stick with the default progression while making smaller tweaks. For example, if you know that some particular lift benefits from more lower-intensity training, you could decrease the intensities for that lift by 5-10%. Conversely, if you know that some particular lift languishes away if intensity is too low for too long, you could potentially bump the intensities in block 1 (weeks 1-7) up to match the intensities of block 2 (weeks 8-14).



Now, let’s move onto the Setup tab. The Setup tab simply takes all of the information in the Quick Setup tab and lays it out on a week-by-week basis. The Quick Setup tab is where you design the program, and the Setup tab is where you can make smaller tweaks once you start training. *Once you start the program, make ongoing changes in the Setup tab, rather than the Quick Setup tab.* Here are a few examples of tweaks you might make in the Setup tab:

1) If you’re coming back from a layoff, and you want to allow your training maxes to increase quickly while you’re retracing old ground, you may specify in the Quick Setup tab that your maxes will increase by a larger percentage when you exceed your rep out targets. By week 9, your strength has mostly recovered, so progressing your training max so quickly is no longer feasible or advisable. So, for week 9 onward, you’d change the amount your training max would increase if you exceeded your RIR target back down to the default values (DA3-DE14, DM3-DQ14, DY3-EC14, etc.).2) If you wanted to increase set volume block-to-block, you could do so in the Setup tab. For example, you could specify that you’re doing 4 sets per exercise in the Quick Setup tab, and stick with those set thresholds for the first block of training (weeks 1-7). Then, in the Setup Tab, you could change your “sets” to 5 for the second block of training (weeks 8-14), and change your “sets” to 6 for the third block of training (weeks 15-21).3) If you realize after week 4 that the RTF (last set rep) targets are too high for a particular lift, you could change the rep out targets for that particular lift in the Setup tab for weeks 5-21.

Below you can see how one week’s worth of program parameters looks in the Setup tab.



The next tab is the “Untouched” tab. You PROBABLY won’t need to use it. It’s for people who want to write their own program from scratch using the tools in this spreadsheet. The basic logic of this spreadsheet is that logic flows from the Quick Setup tab to the Setup tab to the sheets where you log your training (the ones labeled 2x-6x). However, the deload weeks in the default program – weeks 7, 14, and 21 – deviate from the logic in the Quick Setup and Setup tabs. Specifically, there’s no RIR target, and your training max doesn’t increase or decrease based on your performance during deloads. So, instead of pulling logic from the Setup tab, those weeks are “hard coded” into the 2x-6x sheets. Therefore, if you wanted to write a whole new program from scratch, certain things about weeks 7, 14, and 21 would screw up in the 2x-6x tabs. The Untouched tab, on the other hand, pulls logic directly from the Setup tab. So, you could write your own programming, and then cut and paste rows around in the Untouched tab to arrange the exercises the way you want them to be arranged.

The 2x-6x tabs are where you actually log your training. The 2x tab is for people who want to train twice per week, the 3x tab is for people who want to train three times per week, the 4x tab is for people who want to train four times per week, etc.

There are three major things to be aware of in whichever tab (training frequency) you choose.

First, there are hidden rows that contain your training maxes. Here’s how the first week on the 3x tab looks by default with training maxes hidden.



	You can see the arrows and the missing row numbers (4, 6, 8, 17, 19, 21, etc.) on the left hand side of that screenshot. Those are where the hidden rows are. If you click on the arrows, you’ll unhide the hidden rows. Here’s how the first week on the 3x tab looks with all of the hidden rows expanded:



	The numbers in the “TM” rows are your training maxes (for example, 490 for squat, 500 for sumo deadlift, 280 for DB bench, etc.). Those are the numbers that increase or decrease based on the degree to which you exceed or fall short of your RTF target week-to-week, and your working weights (342.5 for squat, 300 for sumo deadlift, 167.5 for DB bench, etc.) are calculated based on those numbers. If you want to re-hide a training max row after expanding it, just right-click the row number, and select “hide row.”

	The second thing to be aware of is how to autoregulate daily training loads using singles at an 8RPE (2RIR). You certainly don’t have to do this, but *if* you want to work up to a heavy single before your main work sets, and you want to use that heavy single to update your training max (and thus your training loads in the current session), you’d fill in the weight you used for your heavy single at an 8RPE in the blue square in the “rep out target” column, to the right of the text reading “single @8”.

For example, in the screenshots above, you can see that the training max for the squat is 490, and the weight to be used for the working sets is 342.5. However, if you worked up to a single at an 8RPE on squat during your first training session, and you hit 460, you could put 460 in the blue “single @8” cell, and it would update your training max. Assuming your “Single @8 percentage” from the Quick Setup tab was 90%, your new training max would be 511, and your new working weight would be 357.5.



	The third major thing to be aware of is how to move exercises around. If you don’t like the default training split and exercise orders, feel free to move exercises wherever you see fit. To do this, you have to CUT AND PASTE (not copy and paste) rows. First, expand the hidden rows with your training maxes. Next, add some additional rows to the spreadsheet so you have some room to work with. Then, just cut and paste rows wherever you want them to go until you have a training split that suits your preferences.

	To actually log your workouts, all you need to do is note the workout for the day (for example, by default, the first squat workout has you doing 3 sets of 10 reps, and one set to failure), complete it, and then log the number of reps you completed on your last set in the “reps on last set” column. If you completed fewer reps than your rep out target, your training max will decrease. If you hit the rep out target on the head, your training max won’t change. If you beat the rep out target on the last set, your training max will increase (by a little bit if you beat the rep out target by a little, and by a lot if you beat the rep out target by a lot). The cells for notes and video links are purely for yourself. Filling in those cells or leaving them blank will not affect anything else in the spreadsheet.

	Below, you can see the effects of falling short of your rep out target, hitting your rep out target, beating your rep out target by a little bit, and beating your rep out target by a lot.



	Above each cell that reads “Accessories”, there’s a blue cell with a dropdown menu. This is where you can select upper back exercises. There’s a slot for upper back exercises in all workouts by default, but you don’t necessarily need to do upper back training in every workout if you don’t want to (2-3 times per week is probably sufficient).



Finally, the unfilled blue squares below “Accessories” are where you can add any other various exercises you want to perform. I’d recommend being judicious with accessories, and not proactively filling in all of the accessory slots simply because they exist. Be conscious about choosing accessories for specific weak points or muscle groups that aren’t already being trained heavily in the program.

For upper back training and accessories, the spreadsheet doesn’t come with a pre-specified progression scheme. Just fill in the weight, sets, and reps completed, and aim to improve your performances over time. The weights, sets, and reps you complete in one workout will auto-fill to the next workout, just so you have a handy record of the targets you’re trying to beat.

As previously mentioned, weeks 7, 14, and 21 are deloads, which is why the rep out targets are listed as “n/a.” Just do 4 sets with the listed weights and move on. I’d also recommend taking it easier with your upper back training and accessories on deload week.

That’s about it\! Remember, for more tips, I’d strongly recommend skipping to the section at the end of this document.

# SBS Linear Progression {#sbs-linear-progression}

This is a program designed for relatively new lifters (or lifters returning to training after a layoff) who can realistically increase their strength on a week-to-week (or nearly week-to-week) basis. In this program, you complete a fixed number of sets and reps for each exercise, and estimate how many more reps you *could* have done on the last set, if you would have taken the last set to failure. If you think you only had one more rep in the tank, your training max will increase by a little bit. If you think you had quite a few more reps in the tank, your training max will increase by a greater amount.

	When you first open your copy of the “SBS Linear Progression” (henceforth referred to as “LP”) spreadsheet, start on the “Quick Setup” tab. This is where you’ll set up your training cycle, and tailor the program to your needs and preferences. Throughout this entire spreadsheet, the blue cells can be edited, but I would strongly recommend not messing with any white cell that contains a formula.

	To start with, set your default rounding increment (Cells A1 and A2). This is the increment by which training loads can increase on this program. For example, if you train using pound plates, and the smallest plates you have are 2.5lb plates, the smallest weight increase you can use is a 5lb increase, so you’d set the rounding increment to “5”. If you’re using kilo plates, and you have 1.25kg plates, the smallest weight increase you can use is a 2.5kg increase, so you’d set the rounding increment to “2.5”. If you need to have multiple rounding increments (for example, if you’re doing some dumbbell exercises, and your dumbbells use different weight increments than your barbells), just set the rounding increment to “0.1” so you can do the rounding for yourself.



	Next, select the four main lifts you want to base your program around (C5-C8). By default, they’re squat, bench press, deadlift, and push press. These are the four exercises that will be trained at slightly higher intensities than the rest of the lifts in the program. If you don’t want to use one (or more) of these exercises, feel free to sub them out with other core lifts you’d like to base your program around, or drop them altogether. For example, if you’re training for powerlifting, it may not be a bad idea to drop push press, or if you’re a climber, it may not be a bad idea to sub out bench press for weighted pull-ups, or if you’re a strongman, it may not be a bad idea to to sub out barbell push press and deadlift for the DL and overhead variations that will be used at an upcoming competition.



	Next, select auxiliary lifts to complement your main exercises (C11-C19). By default, there are two squat auxiliary slots, two bench press auxiliary slots, one deadlift auxiliary slot, one OHP auxiliary slot, and three upper back exercises. Again, you can choose any lifts you want as auxiliaries; those are just the default recommendations. There are dropdown menus with options to choose from, but you can feel free to use exercises that aren’t included in the dropdown menus.



Next, fill in maxes for the main lifts and auxiliaries you choose (D5-D19). If you don’t know your 1RM for some of the lifts you selected (and you probably won’t if you’re a novice lifter), there’s no problem with just using a rough estimate, and starting with a very conservative estimate. Since this program autoregulates training loads based on your performance, if you started with an estimate that’s too low, your training max will increase to an appropriate level soon; if you start with an overestimate, the program will automatically decrease your training max to an appropriate level after a couple of weeks.



As a note, if you decide to use weighted pull-ups or dips as a main exercise or auxiliary exercise, include both your bodyweight and attached weight when entering your 1RM (so, for example, if you weigh 100kg and you can do a pull-up with 50kg hanging from a belt, enter your 1RM as 150kg).

Next, if you want, you can edit the cells labeled “Single @8 percentage” (E5-E19). One way you can autoregulate using this program is by performing a heavy single at an RPE of 8 (2 reps in reserve) before your main work sets for each exercise (more on that later). In general, a single at 8RPE is typically about 90% of your true 1RM, which is why the cells are filled in with “90%” by default. However, if you know that, for example, a single at an 8RPE is closer to 93% of 1RM for your bench press and closer to 87% for your deadlift, you could edit the bench “Single @8 percentage” to be 93%, and the deadlift “Single @8 percentage” to be 87%.



	Next, you can determine how many sets to perform for each exercise (H6-H18). In this program, you perform 3 sets per exercise by default. However, if you know you have better or worse strength endurance and/or recoverability for certain lifts, you could change these set thresholds. For example, if you know you can do a lot of sets of OHP, but only a few sets of deadlift before accumulating a lot of fatigue, you could adjust “sets” up to 5 to OHP and down to 2 for deadlift.



	Next, you can determine how much your training maxes will increase based on your reps in reserve on the last set of each exercise, and how much your training maxes will decrease when you fail to complete the prescribed number of sets (I6-P18). By default, training maxes decrease considerably if you fail to complete all of your prescribed sets, don’t change if you completed the prescribed sets but had 0 reps in reserve after the last set (e.g. your last rep was an all-out grinder), increase a little bit if you have 1-2 reps in reserve after the last set, and increase by a lot if you have 3+ reps in reserve after the last set (I’m writing this with the assumption that your RIR target will be “0”, which is the default for this spreadsheet). However, if the weight increases look too conservative to you, you can increase the degree to which your training max increases if you have 1, 2, or 3+ reps in reserve after your last set.



	Next, you can edit rep targets in the program in cells C24-W36. These cells show the amount of reps you’ll be doing with each percentage of 1RM in the program. If you know you have really good strength endurance with a particular lift, feel free to increase your per-set rep targets for that particular exercise; conversely, if you know you have poor strength endurance for another lift, you could decrease the per-set rep targets for that particular lift.



	Next, you *could* edit your RIR targets in the program in cells C41-W53. The default is 0, meaning that as long as you simply complete the prescribed sets and reps, your training maxes will either stay the same or increase (which is what you should expect on a week-to-week basis when using a linear progression). I would not recommend editing these cells; if you REALLY want to mess around with them, read the paragraph about how they work in the “Last Set Reps in Reserve” section of this document.



Finally, to finish up on the Quick Setup tab, you *could* edit the training intensity for each lift, each week (C58-W70). Since this is a linear progression, the intensity for each lift stays the same week-to-week. However, intensities do vary for lifts that train the same muscle groups (for example, your main squat is trained at 87.5%, your first squat auxiliary is trained at 82.5%, and your second squat auxiliary is trained at 75%), so there’s at least a bit of variety. Again, since this is a linear progression, I really wouldn’t recommend messing around with these cells too much. The only thing you might want to mess with is increasing or decreasing the intensity for particular lifts for all week; this would decrease or increase (respectively) the prescribed reps per set for those exercises. For example, if instead of doing sets of 3, 5, and 8 for your three squats, you wanted to do sets of 8, 10, and 12, you could change the intensities from 87.5%, 82.5%, and 75% to 75%, 70%, and 65% (assuming you left the “rep target” cells with their default values).



Now, let’s move onto the Setup tab. The Setup tab simply takes all of the information in the Quick Setup tab and lays it out on a week-by-week basis. The Quick Setup tab is where you design the program, and the Setup tab is where you can make smaller tweaks once you start training. *Once you start the program, make ongoing changes in the Setup tab, rather than the Quick Setup tab.* Here are a few examples of tweaks you might make in the Setup tab:

1) If you’re coming back from a layoff, and you want to allow your training maxes to increase quickly while you’re retracing old ground, you may specify in the Quick Setup tab that your maxes will increase by a larger percentage based on the RIR you have after your last set for each exercise. By week 9, your strength has mostly recovered, so progressing your training max so quickly is no longer feasible or advisable. So, for week 9 onward, you’d change the amount your training max would increase if you exceeded your RIR target back down to the default values (DA3-DE17, DM3-DQ17, DY3-EC17, etc.).   1) I should note, if you’re using this LP to regain strength after a layoff, I’d probably recommend simply moving on to one of the other programs in this bundle once you’ve regained most of your strength.2) If you wanted to increase set volume over time, you could do so in the Setup tab. For example, you could specify that you’re doing 2 sets per exercise in the Quick Setup tab, and stick with those set thresholds for your first six weeks. Then, in the Setup Tab, you could change your “sets” to 4 for the next six weeks, 5 for the next six weeks, etc.3) If you realize after week 6 that you simply don’t like grinding reps for a particular lift, you could change the RIR cutoffs from 0 to 2 for that particular lift in the Setup tab for weeks 7-21. That way, your training max would only increase if you had at least 3 reps in reserve after your last set.

Below you can see how one week’s worth of program parameters looks in the Setup tab.



The next tab is the “Untouched” tab. It’s for people who want to write their own program from scratch using the tools in this spreadsheet. If that’s you, I’d recommend using one of the other spreadsheets in this bundle (probably the Program Builder). If you’re at a point where you need to make wholesale changes to a program, a linear progression probably isn’t what you need.

The 3x-6x tabs are where you actually log your training. The 3x tab is for people who want to train three times per week, the 4x tab is for people who want to train four times per week, etc.

There are three major things to be aware of in whichever tab (training frequency) you choose.

First, there are hidden rows that contain your training maxes. Here’s how the first week on the 3x tab looks by default with training maxes hidden.



	You can see the arrows and the missing row numbers (4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 19, etc.) on the left hand side of that screenshot. Those are where the hidden rows are. If you click on the arrows, you’ll unhide the hidden rows. Here’s how the first week on the 3x tab looks with all of the hidden rows expanded:



	The numbers in the “TM” rows are your training maxes (for example, 150 for squat, 80 for push press, 200 for deadlift, etc.). Those are the numbers that increase or decrease week-to-week based on how many RIR you have after your last set of each exercise, and your working weights (132.5 for squat, 70 for push press, 150 for deadlift, etc.) are calculated based on those numbers. If you want to re-hide a training max row after expanding it, just right-click the row number, and select “hide row.”

	The second thing to be aware of is how to autoregulate daily training loads using singles at an 8RPE (2RIR). You certainly don’t have to do this, but *if* you want to work up to a heavy single before your main work sets, and you want to use that heavy single to update your training max (and thus your training loads in the current session), you’d fill in the weight you used for your heavy single at an 8RPE in the blue square in the “Last set RIR target” column, to the right of the text reading “single @8”.

For example, in the screenshots above, you can see that the training max for the squat is 150, and the weight to be used for the working sets is 132.5. However, if you worked up to a single at an 8RPE on squat during your first training session, and you hit 140, you could put 140 in the blue “single @8” cell, and it would update your training max. Assuming your “Single @8 percentage” from the Quick Setup tab was 90%, your new training max would be 156, and your new working weight would be 135\.



	I wouldn’t necessarily recommend working up to singles at 8RPE on a linear progression. I’m just making you aware of that functionality if you wanted to use it, and letting you know what purpose these cells serve in case you were curious.

	The third major thing to be aware of is how to move exercises around. If you don’t like the default training split and exercise orders, feel free to move exercises wherever you see fit. To do this, you have to CUT AND PASTE (not copy and paste) rows. First, expand the hidden rows with your training maxes. Next, add some additional rows to the spreadsheet so you have some room to work with. Then, just cut and paste rows wherever you want them to go until you have a training split that suits your preferences.

	To actually log your workouts, all you need to do is note the workout for the day (for example, by default, the first squat workout has you doing 3 sets of 3 reps), complete it, and then log the number of sets completed in the “Sets completed” column, and your actual RIR on the last set in the “RIR on last set” column. If you completed fewer sets than were prescribed, your training max will decrease considerably. If you completed the prescribed number of sets, but the final rep of the last set was an all-out grinder so that you had 0 RIR (assuming you left RIR targets at 0 in the quick setup tab), your training max won’t change. If you had some reps in reserve after the last set, your training max will increase (by a little bit if you only had one rep in reserve, and by more if you had multiple reps in reserve). The cells for notes and video links are purely for yourself. Filling in those cells or leaving them blank will not affect anything else in the spreadsheet.

	Below, you can see the effects of failing to reach your set target, hitting your set target with 0 reps in reserve, only having one rep in reserve after the final set, and having several reps in reserve after the final set.



	One thing to note is that an increase in your training max doesn’t always mean an increase in your training loads. You can see that in the example above where, with 1 RIR after the last set, the training max increased by 1% (150 to 151.5), but the increase wasn’t large enough to increase the training load for the next workout (132.5). That’s perfectly fine, as long as training maxes are increasing, training loads will increase over time as well.

Finally, the unfilled blue squares below “Accessories” are where you can add any other various exercises you want to perform. I’d recommend being judicious with accessories, and not proactively filling in all of the accessory slots simply because they exist. Be conscious about choosing accessories for specific weak points or muscle groups that aren’t already being trained heavily in the program.

For accessories, the spreadsheet doesn’t come with a pre-specified progression scheme. Just fill in the weight, sets, and reps completed, and aim to improve your performances over time. The weights, sets, and reps you complete in one workout will auto-fill to the next workout, just so you have a handy record of the targets you’re trying to beat.

That’s about it\! Remember, for more tips, I’d strongly recommend skipping to the section at the end of this document.

# SBS Novice Hypertrophy {#sbs-novice-hypertrophy}

This is a program designed for relatively new lifters (or lifters returning to training after a layoff) who can realistically improve their performance in the gym on a week-by-week basis. In this program, you aim to complete a fixed number of sets and reps for each exercise. If you complete them, your reps, sets, or load will increase the next time you perform that exercise. If you don’t complete them, you’ll stick with the same sets/reps/weight in the next workout, and aim to improve upon your prior performance.

	When you first open your copy of the “SBS Novice Hypertrophy Program” spreadsheet, start on the “Quick Setup” tab. This is where you’ll set up your training cycle, and tailor the program to your needs and preferences. Throughout this entire spreadsheet, the colored cells with no formulas can be edited, but I would strongly recommend not messing with any white cell that contains a formula.

	To start with, set your default rounding increment for each lift (Cells B5-B26). This is the increment by which training loads can increase on this program. For example, if you train using pound plates, and the smallest plates you have are 2.5lb plates, the smallest weight increase you can use is a 5lb increase, so you’d set the rounding increment to “5”. If you’re using kilo plates, and you have 1.25kg plates, the smallest weight increase you can use is a 2.5kg increase, so you’d set the rounding increment to “2.5”. If you plan on using bodyweight exercises, don’t worry about the rounding increment for those exercises.



	Next, select the exercises you want to do in this program (C5-C26). The default recommendations are 2 compound pec-dominant pressing exercises, 2 compound shoulder-dominant pressing exercises, 2 horizontal pulling movements (e.g. row variations), 2 vertical pulling movements (like pull-ups or pull-downs), 2 compound hip-dominant exercises, 2 compound knee-dominant exercises, one accessory lift apiece for the posterior chain and quads, 2 calf exercises, and 6 “vanity lifts” – other accessories targeting whatever muscle groups you’d like extra work for. If you’re using Google sheets, there are drop-down menus with options for all of these movement patterns except for the vanity lifts. If you want to do an exercise not included in the drop-down menus, feel free. Also note, you don’t *have* to stick with the movement patterns that are recommended by default; you can enter virtually any lifts you want.



	Next, for each exercise, select whether it’s a bodyweight exercise or not (A5-A26). If it’s a bodyweight exercise, enter “yes” (without quotation marks) in the corresponding cell. For example, in the screenshot above, neutral grip pull-ups (C11) are a bodyweight exercise, so A11 is filled in with “yes.” As a note, if you’re going to do weighted pull-ups or dips, treat them as weighted exercises, not bodyweight exercises.



	Next, it’s worth explaining how the progression schemes in this program work.

For bodyweight exercises, training progression is based on the information you put in the red squares (F2-H26). “Starting sets” refers to the number of sets you’ll do on the first week of the program. “Ending sets” refers to the most sets you’ll do for that exercise. “Reps per set increase” refers to how many reps per set you’ll add after completing the maximum number of sets with a given amount of reps.

I think it’ll make the most sense to use an example. The default values are 3 starting sets, 5 ending sets, and 1 rep per set increase. So, if you’re doing pull-ups, you might do 3 sets of 5 reps in the first week. If you complete all 3 sets of 5 reps, you’ll aim for 4 sets of 5 reps the next week. If you complete all of those sets, you’ll aim for 5 sets of 5 reps the next week. If you complete all of those sets, you’ll drop back to 3 sets the next week, and aim to complete 6 reps per set. You’ll build up to 5 sets of 6, and then drop back to 3 sets of 7, etc. If “starting sets” was set to 2 and “ending sets” were still set to 5, you’d start with 2 sets instead of 3, and drop back to 2 sets after completing 5 sets. If “ending sets” was set to 6, you’d work up to 6 sets before dropping back to your “starting sets” and increasing reps per set. If “reps per set increase” was set to 3 instead of 1, you’d progress from sets of 5 to sets of 7 to sets of 9, etc., instead of sets of 5 to 6 to 7 in the example above.In general, “starting sets” and “ending sets” can be higher for exercises that are less fatiguing for you (though 3-5 sets per exercise should be adequate but not excessive for most novice lifters), and “reps per set increase” should be higher for exercises that allow you to complete more reps. For example, if you’re doing bodyweight push-ups and dips, you can almost certainly do more push-ups than dips. Maybe you start with sets of 5 dips and sets of 15 push-ups. You’d probably only want to add one rep per set for the dips (a jump from 5 to 6 reps per set is a non-trivial increase), but you may want to add 3 reps per set for push-ups (a jump from 15 to 18 reps per set would be comparable to a jump from 5 to 6).

For weighted exercises, training progression is based on the information you put in the gray squares (I2-O26). Setup here is similar to the setup for bodyweight exercises, but there are a few additional variables. Instead of the two-step flow of sets increasing and then reps increasing, there’s a three-step flow: sets increase, then reps increase, then loads increase.“Starting sets” and “ending sets” function the same way as they did for bodyweight exercises. “Starting reps” and “ending reps” are a similar concept, but they determine the minimum and maximum number of reps per set you’ll be aiming for in your workouts. “Set increase” and “reps per set increase” determine how much rep and set targets will go up when you successfully complete your workouts. Finally, “weight increase” is the amount that your training loads will increase once the set and rep progression both cap out with a given weight.This will also make more sense with an example. By default, “starting sets” are 3, “ending sets” are 5, “starting reps” are 8, “ending reps” are 12, “set increase” is 1, “reps per set increase” are 2, and “weight increase” is 10%. This means you’ll start with 3 sets of 8 reps. Let’s assume you’re bench pressing 100lb for sets of 8 to start with. In your first workout, you’ll aim to complete 3 sets of 8 reps with 100lb (note: the sheet is agnostic about units). If you complete all 3 sets of 8, your next bench press workout will be 4 sets of 8 reps with 100lb. If you complete those sets, your next bench press workout will be 5 sets of 8 with 100lb. If you complete those sets, you’ll drop back to 3 sets, and aim for 10 reps per set. Then you’ll do 4 sets of 10, 5 sets of 10, 3 sets of 12, 4 sets of 12, and 5 sets of 12, all with 100lb. After completing 5 sets of 12 reps with 100lb, your load will increase by 10%, and you’ll start back over, aiming for 3 sets of 8 reps with 110lb.If you edit the starting/ending sets or reps, or you edit the set or rep increases, just make sure that the set and rep increases will eventually land you evenly on the “ending sets” and/or “ending reps” numbers. For example, if you leave “starting reps” at 8 and increase “ending reps” to 13, “reps per set increase” would have to be either 1 or 5\. If you picked 2, you’d jump from 8 to 10 to 12 reps per set to 14, leapfrogging over your “ending reps” target. With 3, you’d jump from 8 to 11 to 14, and with 4, you’d jump from 8 to 12 to 16\. You’d never land on 13\. That can cause the sheet to malfunction. The same general principle applies to set targets. If the difference between “starting sets” and “ending sets” is divisible by “set increase,” and the difference between “starting reps” and “ending reps” is divisible by “reps per set increase,” you’re golden.As far as novice programs go, the default progression scheme is pretty conservative. If you stick with the default values, you’ll stick with each weight for 9 weeks before increasing load, and the default 10% load increase after reaching your ending set and rep target for each load is pretty modest. That’s by design. The built-in rate of progression is still quick enough to allow for substantial progress over time (if you hit your set and rep targets each week, your training loads will increase by nearly 80% over the course of a year), but you should have plenty of opportunity to really “own” each weight before increasing loads. This should help mitigate injury risk to some degree, and help you work on developing your mind-muscle connection. However, if you feel like the progression scheme is too slow for you, feel free to bump load increases up to 15%.	As a final note, if you want to stick with the same number of sets for a particular exercise, just make “starting sets” and “ending sets” the same number. If you do this, you’ll just progress from “starting reps” to “ending reps” and then increase load. Similarly, if you want to stick with the same rep target for every workout, you can make “starting reps” and “ending reps” the same number. If you do this, you’ll just progress from “starting sets” to “ending sets” and then increase load. For example, starting with the sheet’s default values, if you set “ending sets” to 3, you’d do 3 sets of 8, then 3 sets of 10, then 3 sets of 12, and then increase load and start back over with 3 sets of 8\. If you instead set “ending reps” to 8, you’d do 3 sets of 8, then 4 sets of 8, then 5 sets of 8, and then increase load and start back over with 3 sets of 8\.



	Now, let’s move onto the Setup tab. The Setup tab simply takes all of the information in the Quick Setup tab and lays it out on a week-by-week basis. The Quick Setup tab is where you design the program, and the Setup tab is where you can make smaller tweaks once you start training. *Once you start the program, make ongoing changes in the Setup tab, rather than the Quick Setup tab.* Here are a couple of examples of tweaks you might make in the Setup tab:

1) If you’re coming back from a layoff, and you want to allow your training maxes to increase quickly while you’re retracing old ground, you may specify in the Quick Setup tab that your maxes will increase by a larger percentage after completing ending set/rep targets, and your reps per set will increase by a larger number after completing ending set targets. By week 12, your strength has mostly recovered, so progressing your training weights/reps at such a quick rate is no longer feasible. So, for week 12 onward, you’d decrease the rate at which your training loads (for weighted exercises) and reps per set (for bodyweight exercises) would increase (EJ27-EJ48, EV27-EV48, FH27-FH48, etc. and EG3-EG24, ES3-ES24, FE3-FE24, etc.).2) If you wanted to increase set volume over time, you could do so in the Setup tab. For example, you could specify 3 starting sets and 5 ending sets in the quick setup tab, and after 12 weeks, you could bump those targets up to 4 starting sets and 6 ending sets (EE3-EF48, EQ3-EQ48, FC3-FC48, etc.).

Below you can see how one week’s worth of program parameters looks in the Setup tab.



The next tab is the “Untouched” tab. It’s for people who want to write their own program from scratch using the tools in this spreadsheet. If that’s you, I’d recommend using one of the other spreadsheets in this bundle (probably the Program Builder). If you’re at a point where you need to make wholesale changes to a program, a novice linear progression probably isn’t what you need.

The 3x-5x tabs are where you actually log your training. The 3x tab is for people who want to train three times per week, the 4x tab is for people who want to train four times per week, etc.

There are three major things to be aware of in whichever tab (training frequency) you choose.

	The first is that, for weighted exercises, you need to fill in the amount of weight you use for each of the exercises you perform in your first week of training (the cells say “fill”). Select a weight that you can lift for the target number of reps, but that’s still fairly comfortable. As a general note, if you’re doing weighted pull-ups, chin-ups or dips, include your body weight in the total weight calculation. For bodyweight exercises, you need to fill in the number of reps you perform per set. Do an amount of reps that’s somewhat challenging, but still fairly comfortable (these cells also say “fill”).



	The second major thing to be aware of is how to move exercises around. If you don’t like the default training split and exercise orders, feel free to move exercises wherever you see fit. To do this, you have to CUT AND PASTE (not copy and paste) rows. First, expand the hidden rows with your training maxes. Next, add some additional rows to the spreadsheet so you have some room to work with. Then, just cut and paste rows wherever you want them to go until you have a training split that suits your preferences.

	The third major thing to be aware of is that I’ve left three “Accessories” cells blank on each day. If you want to do more exercises than the spreadsheet allows for by default, you can fill them into those cells. How you progress those exercises is entirely up to you.

	To actually log your workouts, all you need to do is note the workout for the day (for example, by default, the first exercise is dumbbell bench press for 3 sets of 8), choose what weight you want to lift, put the weight in the “weight” column (B4), and note whether you successfully completed all of the sets (3 sets of 8 reps, by default) in the “were all sets completed successfully?” column (E4). If you did complete all sets, just type “yes” (or use the dropdown menu, if you’re using Google sheets). Then you’d move on to your next lift and repeat the process. If it’s a bodyweight exercise, you’d fill in the number of reps per set instead of the weight.

If you don’t complete all sets and reps successfully, you’ll simply repeat the same training prescription next week, and try to improve on your prior performance.



	As one final note, if you get in way over your head and select a weight that’s way too heavy for week 1, you can just manually select a new weight for week 2\. Just fill it in the appropriate cell (N4, in the case of dumbbell bench press, by default). If you selected appropriate weights on week 1, you shouldn’t need to manually edit the “weight” cells again. Once you find appropriate starting weights, the sheet will handle your set/rep/load progressions from there.

That’s about it\! Remember, for more tips, I’d strongly recommend skipping to the section at the end of this document.

# Program Builder {#program-builder}

	If you’re reading this section, I’m going to assume you’ve made yourself familiar with how all of the progressions work up to this point. Everything covered in the instruction document up to this point is included in the Program Builder sheet, plus even more. I’d consider the program builder the definitive version of the SBS strength program concept; its biggest strength is that it allows you to mix-and-match progression schemes that suit your fancy. For example, if you like the RTF progression for most of your lifts, but it burns you out when applied to your deadlift, you could use the original (sets-based) progression or the last set RIR progression for your deadlift. This sheet also offers all of the flexibility most people would need to build an autoregulated program from scratch.	So, let’s discuss the features in this sheet that aren’t present in any of the other sheets. First off, unlike the other core programs, the program builder offers five different options for progressing accessory lifts. Two of them (“Rep increase”, light burgundy cells; and “Set increase then reps increase”, gray cells) are actually the progressions used in the novice hypertrophy program, so you should already be acquainted with them. There’s also “Classic Overload” (teal cells). For this progression, you just assign a set and rep goal (3 sets of 10 reps by default), and how much you’d like the load to increase if you complete all sets successfully (3% by default). So, for example, if you were dumbbell benching 80lb with a goal of 3 sets of 10, and you completed 2 sets of 10 and 1 set of 8, you’d fill in that you completed 2 sets successfully, and the load would stay the same for your next workout. If you completed all 3 sets of 10, you’d fill in that you completed 3 sets successfully, and your training load would increase by 3%, or the smallest possible increment (whichever is larger).



The “fixed number of reps” progression (yellow cells) is similar. For this one, you assign the number of sets you want to do, and the total number of reps you want to complete across all sets (40 total reps over 3 sets by default). If you stick with the default options, you’d do three sets to failure with a given weight, and log how many reps you completed across all three sets. If you got at least 40, your training weight for the next workout would go up 3% or the smallest possible increment (whichever is larger).



The third option I added is a set-by-set setup (it’s a reverse pyramid by default; peach cells). You assign how many reps you want to aim for each set, and how much the load will increase if you successfully complete all of those reps. This progression allows the load to progress on a per-set basis. So, if you meet your rep targets on sets 1 and 2 but not set 3, your loads for sets 1 and 2 will be heavier in your next workout, but your load for set 3 will be the same.



In the program builder, you can enter up to 40 lifts you want to train (quick setup, C5-C44). These can be main lifts, auxiliary lifts, or accessory lifts. If you’re treating a specific lift as an auxiliary lift, and you plan on using one of the progressions that already exist in one of the other programs, type (or toggle using the dropdown menu if using Google sheets) “yes” in its corresponding cell in A5-A44. This will ensure that the appropriate intensities and rep targets are applied in the rest of the spreadsheet. If you’re building your own program from scratch, don’t worry about this toggle.

Like the Novice Hypertrophy program, you can set different rounding increments for each lift, in B5-B44. You can also enter training maxes (D5-D44) and Single @8 percentages (E5-E44) for all of your lifts (where applicable; e.g. when using the SBS strength program, RTF, last set RIR, hypertrophy template, or LP progressions. You don’t need to enter a training max if you’re planning on using one of the five accessory progressions for a particular lift).	Don’t bother editing all of the progression information for all of the different progressions for each lift (F2-AZ44). Just worry about the progression you want to use for each particular lift. For example, if you know you want to use the RTF progression for the first lift you fill out, just make sure that the information in X5-AF5 (the cells relating to the RTF progression for your first lift) is to your liking. If you know you want to use the “Classic Overload” accessory progression for your fifth lift, just make sure that the information in AG9-AH9 (the cells relating to the classic overload progression for your fifth lift) is to your liking.	The “Reps at a given percent” and “RIR cutoffs” tables in rows 46-132 are identical to those same tables in the SBS strength program spreadsheet. If you want to use the SBS strength program progression for a particular lift, and you want to adjust your rep targets or RIR cutoffs at certain intensities, these are the tables you’d edit. Again, only worry about the rows corresponding to the lift(s) you want to use the SBS strength program progression for.	The “Rep target” and “Last set RIR target” tables in rows 136-221 combine the information in the “Last set RIR” template and the Linear Progression template, since they both run on the same spreadsheet logic. If you want to use the Linear Progression presets for a particular lift, type (or toggle using the drop-down menu, if using Google sheet) “yes” in its corresponding cell in A138-A177. That selection is automatically repeated in the blacked-out cells in A182-A221; *don’t* edit those cells.

The “Normal Set Rep Target” and “Last Set Rep Target” tables in rows 225-310 combine the information of the Last Set RTF template and the Hypertrophy template, since they both run on the same spreadsheet logic. As before, there’s a toggle if you want to use the Hypertrophy Template presets for a particular lift (A227-A266), and as before, that selection is automatically repeated in the blacked out cells below (*don’t* edit them).



Rows 312-353 contain the intensity at which you’ll train each lift, each week. If you selected the “auxiliary”, “Linear Progression” or “Hypertrophy Template” options for a particular lift, the intensity table should automatically be updated to reflect those choices. If you’re using any of the accessory progressions for particular lifts, don’t worry about the weekly intensities for those lifts; the accessory progressions are solely based on your performance in the previous week of training. They aren’t calculated using a training max. If you want to build a new progression from scratch for any of your main lifts, the intensity table is the place to do it.

Rounding out the quick setup tab, rows 356-397 contain deload toggles, and cells B399-C403 let you define how deloads will look. In the default SBS strength programs, there are deloads on weeks 7, 14, and 21, so those weeks are pre-toggled as deloads for all lifts. If you’re making another progression from scratch, feel free to place deloads wherever you want. In the Deload Details cells (B399-C403), you can define how many reps per set (C400) and how many sets (C401) you’ll do on your deload weeks, the intensity you’ll train at (C402), and how (or if) your training maxes will change after a deload week (C403). So, if you wanted to keep intensity high but volume very low for your deload week, you could set the intensity to 80-85%, and prescribe 2-4 sets of 1-2 reps. If you wanted to drop intensity really low, you could also do that. In the original SBS strength program spreadsheets, your training maxes don’t change following a deload. If you want to be able to ease into your next block of training, you could set your training maxes to decrease by 3% (enter “-3%” in C403) following a deload so that the first week or two of your next training block is a little easier. Conversely, if you’re making progress quickly, you could still have your training maxes increase by 1-2% during deload weeks. Note: the deload logic doesn’t apply to lifts using any of the accessory progressions.Just like the original spreadsheets, the “Setup” tab is auto-populated with information from the quick setup tab. If you want to edit or tweak things on a week-by-week basis after delineating the broad strokes of the program in the Quick Setup tab, you can do so in the Setup tab.The “Program” tab contains all of the information pulled from the “Setup” tab. The cells with the information ***start at row 150***. From here, you simply need to cut and paste (NOT COPY AND PASTE) rows to make your program. If, for example, on your first training day, you wanted to do squats with the “SBS Strength Program” progression, bench with the RTF progression, and a dumbbell curl reverse pyramid, you’d cut and paste the blue squat rows to the top of the sheet (rows 2-4), the green bench rows under that (rows 5-7), and the peach DB curl rows under that (rows 8-11). From there, you’re off to the races. Just make sure you’re cutting and pasting the cells for each exercise that use the progression(s) you want to use.I’ll show you how this looks, step-by-step:1\) Cut the SBS Strength Program squat rows (blue), which should be somewhere around row 150\.2\) Paste those rows to the top of the sheet3\) Cut the green (RTF) bench rows, which should be around row \~4004\) Paste those rows near the top of the sheet, below where you pasted the squat rows5\) Cut the peach (Reverse Pyramid) Dumbbell curl rows, which should be around row \~7006\) Paste those rows near the top of the sheet, below the bench rows.7\) Hide the training max rows (if desired), by right clicking rows 3 and 6 and selecting “Hide Row”8\) Fill in your week 1 training weights for Dumbbell curls9\) Cut and paste everything down 1 row, and add a header in row 2 that says “Day 1,” just for the sake of tidiness (or do this first, if you’re not forgetful like me).10\) Repeat the same basic process with all of the lifts and progressions you want to use in your program\! Once you get the hang of it, it’s SO much quicker to make custom programs in this spreadsheet than making them manually.

As with the novice hypertrophy template, you need to fill out how many reps per set you’re doing for the first week if using the “Rep Increase” accessory progression, and you need to fill out your week 1 weights for all other accessory progressions. Just fill out the blank gray squares.On the program sheet, any cell that’s already populated with a number is a cell with a formula behind it. I’d recommend against editing those cells unless you’re really confident in what you’re doing. The gray cells are the ones you can/should fill in that affect load progressions.You can get creative with the peach cells, since they allow set-by-set progressions. For example, you could build a full pyramid using two adjacent sets of peach cells. If you wanted to do a triceps extension pyramid, you could make, for example, both “lift 17” and “lift 18” triceps extensions, with 12 reps on set 1, 8 reps on set 2, 6 reps on set 3, 10 reps on set 4, and 20 reps on set 5; sets 4 and 5 would just end up being sets 1 and 2 for the “lift 18” cells. You could really do any set-by-set programming you wanted with those cells.If you mess anything up on the “Program” tab, don’t worry\! You can just make a duplicate of the “Untouched” tab, and you’re off to the races again.The sheet should function just fine on mobile, but for setting everything up, I’d highly recommend using your laptop/desktop.

# Other Thoughts and Suggestions

First things first, based on the data I’ve gathered thus far, 1\) the RTF template has tended to produce the best results for people, followed closely by the hypertrophy template, and 2\) people who regularly do overwarm singles before their working sets (whether or not they use the “single @8RPE function to autoregulate their training weights for the day) have tended to make better strength gains than people who don’t. If you’re debating about which version of these programs to run, the RTF or hypertrophy template, with overwarm singles, would be my recommendation.		Whether you start with conservative training maxes or enter in true 1RMs to start the program is entirely up to you. Since the program will adjust your training loads up or down based on performance, you should naturally find yourself training with appropriate loads within 3-4 weeks, regardless of where you start your maxes out. For this same reason, if you don’t know your 1RM for one of your auxiliary lifts, a decent estimate is completely fine. As long as you’re anywhere near the right ballpark, it’ll be fine. If you’re not used to high-rep training, it’s probably not a bad idea to start with really conservative training maxes (85-90% of your true maxes) during your first run of the hypertrophy template.

	Regarding terminology, the only thing you need to know that’s not squarely within virtually all lifters’ lingo is “reps in reserve” or “RIR.” This is exactly what it sounds like. If you do a set of 8 reps, but you’re pretty sure you could have done 10, you had 2 reps in reserve. [Research has shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30747900) that most lifters are pretty good at estimating reps in reserve as long as they’re within 2-3 reps of failure. RIR cutoffs are used in the “main” version of the program and the “last set RIR” version. If you don’t trust your ability to estimate RIRs, feel free to use the “reps to failure” version.

	Regarding “failure,” whether you choose to define it as true failure (going until you actually miss a rep), 0 RIR (you don’t fail a rep, but you know you couldn’t have completely another rep), or technical failure (ending a set when you feel your form start to slip) is up to you. Any of the three definitions can work, as long as you apply it consistently. In general, I’d probably recommend against true failure. Defining failure as 0 RIR is probably fine for MOST people, unless your form REALLY breaks down when you’re grinding out your last few reps.

	You estimate reps in reserve at the end of a set, while you're still under the bar or immediately after you re-rack it. Ask yourself, “If I had just gone to failure, how many more reps do I think I could have done?” Even if you’re using a version of the program that doesn’t require training to failure, you can occasionally check your RIR estimates by including failure sets. If you’re using the original template and you’re supposed to end your sets of bench press when you have 3 reps in reserve after performing a set of 5, simply do sets of 5 until you think you’ve reached the point that you could only do 3 more reps, *don’t rack the bar yet*, and then rep out to failure. Did you get 2-4 more reps? Good\! Did you only get exactly 3 more reps? Even better\! Did you just get 1 rep, or did you get 5+ reps? Then it may be worth checking your reps in reserve against failure sets a bit more frequently until your accuracy improves. If you’re using the original template and you do a rep-out test on your final set, just count the sets you actually completed when you’re filling out the spreadsheet (so if you repped out set 7, report that you completed 7 sets), and make a note to yourself about the rep-out set and your RIR accuracy. If you’re using the “last set RIR” template, treat the “extra” reps you got as your RIR. So, for example, if you were supposed to do sets of 5, and you got 9 reps when you repped out your last set, you’d report that on the spreadsheet as 4RIR, and make a note to yourself reporting that you actually took the last set to failure, and reporting your RIR accuracy.

	One thing you may notice is that there appears to be a discord between the “reps to failure” and “last set RIR” versions of the program. The last-set targets and the last set RIRs don’t necessarily match up. For example, in your first squat workout on the “reps to failure” sheet, you’ll do 4 sets of 5, followed by one set where you’re aiming to complete at least 10 reps. That would imply that, if you stopped at 5 reps on the last set, you should have at least 4 reps in reserve. However, the critical RIR (determining whether to increase or decrease your training max) on the “last set RIR” sheet is 3\. There’s a method behind the madness with this decision. I want all three versions of the program to provide similar levels of training stress. If there was a perfect correspondence between the “last set RIR” and the “reps to failure” versions (i.e. if critical RIR in the first squat workout was 4 rather than 3, corresponding to 9 reps to failure), the only difference between the two programs would be that “reps to failure” version would finish each exercise with one very hard set to failure, while the “last set RIR” version would just finish with another submaximal set, decreasing overall training stress. However, with a lower critical RIR threshold for load increases, you’ll naturally be able to advance your training maxes a bit quicker with the “last set RIR” version, allowing you to train with slightly heavier loads during your working sets. So, a few weeks into the program, the difference may be 4 submaximal sets and one set to failure with 200 with “reps to failure”, versus 5 submaximal sets with 210-215 with “last set RIR.”

If you want to hit an “overwarm single” at 85-93% before your work sets, but want to stick with the built-in autoregulated load progression used in the program, you can just do the overwarm single and just not log it in the corresponding “single @8” cell. *Especially* during the first block of the original, RTF, last set RIR, and hypertrophy programs, I’d strongly encourage you to do this, especially if you’re someone who loses comfort with heavy loading pretty quickly. I’ve been collecting data from people who’ve completed the program, and the folks who do heavy singles before their work sets (especially for their main lifts; always doing them for all auxiliaries may be slightly overkill) seem to be getting better results overall.

As a general note, the pre-filled auxiliary lifts shouldn’t necessarily be interpreted as “recommended” auxiliaries. I just wanted to pre-fill the sheets so that you could get a feel for how they look and function when you first download them. Pick auxiliaries for yourself based on your preferences, strengths and weaknesses, and available equipment.

If you’re someone who gets worn down quickly from constantly training with high relative loads, you may want to slot in a deload between weeks 17 and 18 on the original, RTF, or last set RIR progressions. Otherwise, you’ll be training at 85% or above for 5 straight weeks. That’s totally fine for most people, but if you know that doesn’t work well for you, feel free to add in that deload.

If you want to do a true “work capacity” block, do the original version of the program (SBS strength program sheet. Not reps to failure or last set RIR), start with very conservative training maxes (\~88% of the training maxes you’d typically use), and run the first block twice. By the end of your first run, assuming you beat the set target each week (which you should), your training maxes will be “caught up” to where they should be, and during your first run of the block, you should be able to do a TON of sets, building awesome work capacity in the process.

There’s a slot for upper back work every session in several of the programs. I’d recommend doing a few sets of rows or pull-ups/pull-downs every workout if you decide to train twice or three times per week. If you use one of the higher frequency programs, don’t feel obligated to train your upper back every workout. You certainly can, but 3ish times per week is fine.

You really can make the main lifts whatever you want, within reason. If you don’t want to overhead press, you can sub in more benching (or just drop the overhead work altogether; for powerlifters, I’d probably recommend 4 benching movements and no overhead pressing). If you know you can only recover from deadlifts once per week, you can sub in the deadlift auxiliary work for something else (maybe more squatting), or just drop it. If you want to train weighted pull-ups as a core lift, you can do that too; just make sure you count your bodyweight along with any added weight when estimating your 1RM and when calculating training loads.

Don’t worry too much about your calculated training maxes in the spreadsheet. They’re simply numbers used to calculate your training weights for the day, and they may be considerably heavier or lighter than your true max. For example, if you have great strength endurance and recover well between sets, your training max will probably exceed your actual 1RM by a considerable margin, but in doing so, it’ll make sure the training weights you end up using are appropriate.

For sets that are “easy,” make sure you are still moving every rep as explosively as possible. This is extremely important. Lower the eccentric under control, and then move the bar on the concentric like you’re trying to throw it through the ceiling.

Rest periods are what you make them. I’d recommend resting AT LEAST 2-3 minutes between sets, but if you use super long rest intervals, you’ll naturally fatigue at a slower rate, and thus be able to do more sets before hitting the target RIR using the original program. This could inflate your training max to the point that loads become unmanageable once things get heavy. That’s not the end of the world (if you get fewer than 4 sets, the program will bump your training maxes back down automatically, so it’s self-correcting), but it’s something to be aware of.

Seriously, feel free to tinker in the “quick setup” and “setup” tabs if you scan the workouts and think, “this looks like it’s just going to be way more challenging for Lift A than Lift B.” There are pretty big differences in strength endurance between people, and there can be big differences in strength endurance between lifts within the same individual. The defaults in the sheet should get most people “close enough,” but don’t be shy about making the program your own.

To save some time, you can do some supersetting if you want. I’d recommend sticking with either agonist/antagonist supersets (i.e. bench and rows) or supersets for two unrelated motor patterns (i.e. OHP and deadlift). As long as you aren’t supersetting two pressing exercises, a deadlift and a squat exercise, or any of the core lifts with an accessory lift training the same muscle group, you should be fine. To be clear, I’m not necessarily recommending that you do supersets (I do think results will be at least a bit better if you do all of your sets with one exercise before moving on to the next one), but if you’re pressed for time, supersetting is a good option to make your workouts more time-efficient.

If you want to switch between versions of the program for whatever reason, it’s easy enough to do. Simply make sure the “quick setup” and “setup” options of the new version of the program are to your liking (rounding is correct, the correct auxiliary lifts are selected, and you make any other tweaks that you made to the prior version you were using), and fill in your current training maxes on the actual tracking sheet (2x, 3x, 4x, etc.), on the week of the program you’re currently on. So, if you were doing the SBS strength program (original template) training 4x per week, and you want to switch to the “last set RIR” version, and you’re currently on week 7 of the program, you’d expand the hidden rows where your training maxes are, you’d get your training maxes for each lift *on week 7*, and you’d fill those training maxes in on week 7 of the “last set RIR” version. From there, you should be able to dive right into the “last set RIR” version of the program as if you’d been doing it all along.

Conversely, if you set your program up in the program builder, it’s even easier to sub out lifts or progressions. Just cut and paste the old lift/progression out of the program, cut and paste the new lift/progression in, update your training maxes, and you’re off to the races.

If you would need two different “rounding” increments (for example, if you’d be increasing loads on the bar by 2.5kg, but you’re using a dumbbell lift as an auxiliary lift, and dumbbells go up in 2kg increments), I’d recommend just setting “rounding” to 0.5. You’ll need to invest a little mental effort to round numbers in your head, but that shouldn’t be too hard. If you’re confident with editing spreadsheets, you could also just change the rounding increments for the lift(s) that need different rounding increments, but I wouldn’t recommend going that route unless you’re really confident about your ability to edit the formulas without messing anything up. Alternately, set your program up in the program builder, which allows each lift to have a different rounding increment.

If you’re primarily strength training for non-strength sports (football, basketball, real football, etc.), the last set RIR version, in particular, would be a good option. I'd probably bump the RIR targets on the quick setup tab up by 1-2, though (so if it's currently 2 with a particular load, make it 3-4). Staying a little further away from failure may aid in power/velocity development, which will carry over even better to most sports than raw strength gains (though the loads should still be heavy enough to get stronger). 

If you’re running the “last set RIR” template, and you still have a lot of reps in reserve at the end of the last set, you may not be confident about accurately estimating your RIR. One option is to simply continue the set until you reach an RIR you do feel comfortable with. So, for example, if you’re doing sets of 5, you don’t feel confident estimating your RIR when you have more than 3 reps in reserve, and you have a lot of reps in reserve after you complete 5 reps on the last set, you could keep doing reps until you reach 3RIR. If you reach 3 RIR on rep 9 (after 4 extra reps), you’d fill in the “RIR on last set” cell with 7 (4 extra reps plus 3 RIR), since you now know you had 7 reps in reserve when you reached the prescribed 5 reps.

Once you’re done with one of the programs (other than the LP and novice hypertrophy programs), feel free to run it again. I wrote these to be programs that you should be able to stick with for a long time. If you completed all 21 weeks and hit new 1RMs, you can just download a fresh version of the sheet, plug your shiny new maxes in, and go for it. If you just want to run the first 14 weeks, you can plug your training maxes at the end of week 14 in as your new training maxes to start another run. If you want to test your 1RMs at the end of the program, I’d recommend testing them either near the end of week 21, or near the start of week 22\.

Since the program adjusts your training maxes based on performance, it should be able to accomodate you regardless of what’s going on in your life. If you’re in a caloric surplus, your stress outside the gym is low, you’re sleeping a bunch, etc., that just means you’ll beat your performance targets more often and progress faster. If you’re in a calorie deficit, you’re stressed out, sleep is dodgy, etc., that just means you’ll beat your performance targets less often and progress at a slightly slower rate (or, you may regress, but the sheet will at least bump your training maxes down instead of telling you to attempt unmanageable workouts week after week).

If you’re doing the original version of the program and you started with conservative training maxes, you may be able to just do sets until the cows come home. I wouldn’t recommend doing more than \~12 sets, if that’s the case. If you notice things are still really easy after set 6, consider shortening your rest intervals to make things more challenging for yourself.

During the deload weeks (weeks 7, 14, and 21 for all of the non-novice programs), you just do 5 sets of each lift with the programmed weight. You don’t do a rep-out set if you’re using the reps to failure version, and you don’t just keep doing sets until the loads get challenging if you’re using the original version.

If you live in a country that uses commas for decimals instead of periods, the spreadsheet may freak out if you set the rounding intervals to 2.5 (or 0.5, or any decimal figure). If that happens, simply replacing the period with a comma (2,5 or 0,5) should take care of the issue.

If you want to do more than three accessories on a particular training day, simply insert a new row under the last row of accessories.

The accessories are not programmed for you. I’ve just set the sheets up so that all of the data for your accessories transfer over week-to-week, just to make your life easier when programming accessories. Interpret those weights/reps/sets as goals to beat.

To change out an auxiliary lift, change it on the quick setup tab, but *don't change your training max on the quick setup tab*. Expand the row with your weekly training maxes for the lift you're subbing out, and simply edit the training max so that it's appropriate for the new auxiliary lift you're subbing in, on the week you're subbing it in. So, if you were doing front squats for the first 7 weeks, but you want to start doing high bar squats starting week 8, you'd swap out front squats for high bar squats on the quick setup tab, make a note to yourself on the actual program spreadsheet (2x, 3x, 4x, etc.) if you want, expand the training max row over the front squat/high bar squat row, and put in your high bar squat training max in the appropriate cell on week 8\. I wouldn’t necessarily recommend changing out auxiliary lifts, but I wouldn’t necessarily recommend against it either. If you do decide to substitute auxiliary lifts, I’d recommend keeping each batch for at least the entirety of a 7-week block.

If you set your program up in the program builder, subbing in a new auxiliary lift is even easier. Again, just cut and paste the old auxiliary out, and cut and paste the new auxiliary in.

If your time in the gym is limited and you need to cut a workout short, fill in the spreadsheet as if you completed the sets/reps necessary for your training max to neither increase nor decrease. The spreadsheet is “dumb” insofar as it doesn’t know if you did fewer sets because your performance was actually down or because life just crunched your gym time. You probably don’t want to bump your training maxes down because you only had time to complete 3 sets one day instead of 5, even though you could have completed 5 sets if you weren’t as rushed. Just make a note to yourself about your actual performance for your own records.

If you accidentally use the wrong weights in a workout, I have some suggested solutions. First of all, I wouldn’t recommend editing the weight used in the spreadsheet. It won’t “know” that you used a different weight for purposes of calculating a new training max. Just make a note in the “notes” column with the weight you actually used. If you accidentally used a load that was lighter than you were supposed to use, fill out the spreadsheet so that it doesn’t change your training max for the next week. If you’re using the original version, enter a number of sets completed that falls within the target range (4, 5, or 6 by default, if you didn’t edit the target set range). If you’re using the “last set RIR” version, fill it out so that “sets completed” and “RIR on last set” match the numbers in the “set goal” and “last set RIR target” columns. If you’re using the reps to failure version, fill it out so that “reps on last set” matches “rep out target” for the day. If you accidentally used a load that was heavier than you were supposed to use, and you fell short of your target(s) for the day, also fill out the sheet as if you matched (but didn’t exceed) your target(s) – exactly the same as described above. If you used a heavier load and you still met or exceeded your target(s) for the day, fill the sheet out so that your training max goes up. In other words, enter a number barely higher than your set target on the original version (7, if you didn’t edit the set targets), a “reps on last set” 1 rep higher than “rep out target” on the “reps to failure” version, or an “RIR on last set” 1 higher than “last set RIR target” on the “last set RIR” version.

If you’re primarily using the spreadsheets on a mobile device, I’d recommend hiding the weeks you’re not using in order to minimize required scrolling.

I just want to reiterate once more near the end of this document (so hopefully it sticks in everyone’s brains): *you have to put in the effort for this program to work*. Some beta testers took the sets/rep/RIR targets as *prescriptions* rather than landmarks. If you don’t ever exceed those targets, your training max will never change in the spreadsheet, and you probably won’t get much stronger. Don’t lie to yourself about RIRs (or cheat your range of motion on sets to failure) to do more sets or progress in loads faster, but also don’t just stick with 4-6 sets (original)/always report the target RIR (last set RIR)/stop at the reps to failure target (reps to failure) if you *can* do more sets below the target RIR, if you did actually have more reps in reserve, or if you could actually do more reps on your set to failure.
