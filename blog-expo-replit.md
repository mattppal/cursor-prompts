Mobile app development has traditionally been a complex endeavor requiring specialized tools, extensive setup, and platform-specific knowledge. Today, we're excited to show you how to build and deploy mobile apps directly from your browser using Replit and Expo.

## What is Replit?

Replit turns your ideas into apps, fast. With Replit, anyone—technical or non-technical—can build and deploy fully-functional, full-stack apps directly from their browser, without any installation, setup, or configuration. Our AI-powered tools, Agent and Assistant, enable you to create entire applications from natural language, turning bullet points into working apps in minutes.

What sets Replit apart is our integrated development environment. You can work in any programming language instantly, and our cloud services let you add databases, cloud storage, authentication, and other integrations without ever leaving your browser tab. Join our community of 36 million developers to create apps and instantly share them worldwide.

## From idea to mobile app in minutes

Replit's integration with Expo enables you to:
- Create full-stack mobile applications without any local setup
- Deploy your apps directly to your iOS or Android device
- Iterate rapidly with real-time updates
- Leverage Replit's AI tools for faster development

## Getting started

The process is straightforward. Start by remixing our Expo template in Replit, which comes pre-configured with all the necessary dependencies and setup. Your development environment is instantly ready—no installations, no configuration, just pure creation.

## Building your first mobile app

Once you've remixed the template, you can immediately begin building. Here's what makes the Replit + Expo workflow special:

1. **Zero setup required**
   - Your development environment is ready instantly
   - All dependencies are pre-installed
   - No local SDK or development tools needed

2. **Real-time development**
   - See changes instantly on your device
   - Test and debug in real-time
   - Collaborate with others in the same workspace

3. **AI-powered development**
   - Use Agent to scaffold entire mobile applications
   - Let Assistant help you add features and fix bugs
   - Transform natural language into working mobile code

## From development to device

Getting your app onto your device is just as seamless:

1. Build your app using Expo's cloud services
2. Generate a QR code for instant installation
3. Test your app directly on your device

The entire process happens without leaving your browser, making mobile development accessible to everyone—whether you're a seasoned developer or just getting started.

## Why this matters

Apps are the new websites, and we believe everyone should be able to create them. By combining Replit's browser-based development environment with Expo's mobile development platform, we're making mobile app creation as simple as building a website.

## Assistant tips and tricks for mobile development

While Agent helps you go from zero to MVP, Assistant is your pair programming companion for refining and enhancing your mobile app. Here are some proven tips to get the most out of Assistant:

1. **Keep sessions focused**
   - Dedicate each chat to a specific feature or task
   - Think of Assistant like a human developer—it works best when focused on one thing at a time
   - Stay on topic to get faster, higher-quality responses

2. **Create multiple chat sessions**
   - Start fresh chats for different features
   - Create new sessions after major file updates
   - Archive old chats to keep your workspace clean
   - Think of each chat as having its own memory context

3. **Leverage file mentions and context**
   - Mention specific files when requesting changes
   - Share screenshots of UI designs you want to replicate
   - Add URLs or website screenshots for reference
   - Provide as much context as possible for better results

4. **Learn while building**
   - Ask Assistant about frameworks and concepts you encounter
   - Understanding the underlying technology helps you write better prompts
   - Use Assistant as both a teacher and a coding partner
   - Learn about mobile-specific concepts like Expo middleware

5. **Preview and iterate**
   - Review changes before applying them
   - Use the rollback feature to try different solutions
   - Create feedback loops: implement, test, rollback if needed
   - Don't be afraid to experiment—you can always undo changes

Remember: Agent helps you create the foundation of your mobile app, while Assistant helps you refine and perfect it. Use both tools in tandem for the best results.
